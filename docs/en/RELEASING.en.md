# Releasing BWOC

> [!abstract] How to cut a release of the bwoc toolkit (`bwoc` CLI + `bwoc-agent` daemon). Releases are tag-driven: pushing a CalVer tag like `v2026.5.22-0` triggers the cross-platform build + GitHub Release upload pipeline.

## Dual versioning — what to read first

BWOC uses **two version namespaces deliberately**:

| Namespace | Scheme | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cargo SemVer | `0.1.405` | `Cargo.toml` workspace + `Software-Version` | Internal dev checkpoint. Auto-bumped on every Claude Code `.rs` / `.toml` edit. |
| Release CalVer | `v2026.5.22-0` | Git tag, GitHub Release, asset filenames | **Public release identity.** Tag triggers `release.yml`. |

Full policy in [`VERSION.md`](../../VERSION.md) §"Versioning Policy — Dual Namespaces". The short version: Cargo SemVer is a dev checkpoint; the public release name is CalVer.

## Pre-flight

Before tagging, the maintainer should verify:

- [ ] **CI is green** on `main` for the most recent commit — see [Actions → CI](https://github.com/bemindlabs/BWOC-Framework/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
- [ ] **`CHANGELOG.md`** has a section for the CalVer tag you're about to push. Rename the existing `[Unreleased]` to `[v2026.5.22-0] — 2026-05-22` and create a new empty `[Unreleased]` above it.
- [ ] **`VERSION.md`** auto-updates on edits; nothing to manually bump for a release.
- [ ] **No uncommitted changes** — release artifacts should reflect a clean tree.

## Cut the tag

Choose today's CalVer tag — `vYYYY.M.D-<patch>`, where patch starts at 0 and increments for same-day re-issues:

```bash
git tag v2026.5.22-0
git push origin v2026.5.22-0
```

The tag matches the workflow's filter (`v[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].*`) and triggers [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml):

1. **Matrix build** — 4 release-mode targets in parallel:
   - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - `aarch64-apple-darwin` (macOS Apple Silicon)
   - `x86_64-apple-darwin` (macOS Intel)
   - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
2. **Package** each as `bwoc-<tag>-<target>.{tar.gz|zip}` containing `bwoc`, `bwoc-agent`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. **Sidecar** a `.sha256` next to each archive.
4. **Auto-create GitHub Release** with notes generated from the commit range since the previous tag.
5. **Upload** all artifacts. `fail_on_unmatched_files: true` aborts the workflow if any archive is missing — partial releases never ship.

## Same-day re-issue

Bump the patch number, not the date:

```
v2026.5.22-0    # first release of the day
v2026.5.22-1    # re-issue (e.g. broken artifact pulled, fix forward)
v2026.5.22-2    # second re-issue
```

This keeps the date stable while making the iteration explicit.

## Prerelease vs stable

CalVer tags **always** contain `-<patch>`, so the workflow can't auto-detect prerelease from the tag shape (the way SemVer tags like `v0.1.0-rc1` do). Every CalVer release is treated as **stable** by default; flip the GitHub Release's "Set as a pre-release" toggle by hand for genuinely experimental builds.

In practice you rarely need this — same-day patch bumps cover most "release something quickly" cases without the prerelease label.

## What's NOT in the pipeline yet

- **Code signing** — Apple notarization (macOS) and Windows Authenticode are not configured. Binaries ship unsigned with SHA-256 checksums; users see "untrusted developer" prompts on first launch. Adding signing requires the maintainer to provision certs and store keys in GitHub Actions secrets.
- **Linux ARM / musl** — only `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` builds. `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` can be added when there's user demand.
- **Homebrew formula / Scoop manifest / cargo binstall metadata** — distribution-system integrations live in their own ecosystems.

## Rolling back

If a tagged release ships broken artifacts:

1. **Don't** delete the tag — the GitHub Release retains the broken binaries, and users may already have downloaded them. Same-day re-issues exist so the timeline is auditable.
2. Cut a new same-day patch (e.g. `v2026.5.22-1` after `v2026.5.22-0`) with the fix.
3. Edit the broken release's notes to point at the replacement.

CalVer's monotonic ordering keeps the rollback simple: the highest patch suffix on the latest date is the canonical "current" build.
