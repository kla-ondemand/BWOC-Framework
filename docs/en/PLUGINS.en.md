# Framework Plugins

A **framework plugin** extends the framework with capabilities that do not belong in every agent but should be available to agents and workspaces that need them. Plugins are loaded by the **framework runtime** — they are operator-facing, not agent-facing.

This spec defines the plugin kinds, manifest format, lifecycle hooks, loading mechanism, and verification gates. The first reference plugin (`memory-tier2-noop`) ships alongside this spec — both lands and proves the format together.

> [!abstract] Status: initial scaffold. Manifest tables and lifecycle hooks below are normative; prose may be refined as story BWOC-1..3 work refines the contract. The first reference plugin lands in BWOC-7.

---

## Skill vs Plugin

Skills and plugins share a substrate (TOML manifest, neutrality gate, per-workspace opt-in) and split on **who invokes them**.

| | Skill | Plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Spec | [`SKILLS.en.md`](SKILLS.en.md) | this doc |
| Audience | Agent author | Workspace operator |
| Opt-in via | `<agent>/config.manifest.json` | `workspace.toml [plugins]` |
| Invoker | The agent during its own operation | The framework runtime |
| Example | worktree discipline, bilingual parity check | Tier 2 memory backend, additional LLM backend |
| Lifecycle scope | Per-agent | Per-workspace |

Pick the layer that matches *who turns it on*. If an individual agent's logic calls it, it is a skill. If the workspace loads it once for everyone, it is a plugin.

---

## Plugin Kinds

Every plugin declares a `kind`. Kinds define the lifecycle hooks the framework will call. Four kinds ship with this spec:

| Kind | What it extends | Lifecycle owner |
|---|---|---|
| `memory-backend` | Tier 2 memory (semantic search, vector store, deep-memory CLI) | The agent's memory subsystem |
| `llm-backend` | Backends beyond the five declared (`claude`, `antigravity`, `codex`, `kimi`, `ollama`) | `bwoc spawn` |
| `workflow` | External system integrations (issue trackers, code review, CI) | The agent calling out |
| `audit` | Inspection of the workspace against external standards (ISO/IEC 29110, ISO 9001, ISO 20000-1, ISO 27001) or operator-authored audits (license headers, doc parity, secret scans) | `bwoc audit` CLI |

A plugin sets `kind` once. Cross-kind plugins are not supported — split them.

The `audit` kind was added in `BWOC-EPIC-2`; for the rationale (why `audit`, not `compliance` or `policy`) and the ISO standards roadmap that motivates it, see the [BWOC-19 design note](../../notes/2026-05-26_iso-compliance-plugins.md).

### What plugins are NOT

- **Not a loophole for vendor-specific framework logic.** The five declared backends are first-class and live in spec, not as plugins. Vendor phrasing in `AGENTS.md` is still forbidden (**Samānattatā**).
- **Not a place for one-off scripts.** Those belong with the agent that uses them.
- **Not skills with extra steps.** If an agent calls it during its own operation, it is a skill (see [`SKILLS.en.md`](SKILLS.en.md)).

## Audit Findings Schema

Every `audit` plugin's `invoke` returns a list of **findings**. The schema below is normative — runnable plugins and stubs alike MUST emit findings conforming to this shape, and the `bwoc audit run --json` envelope from `BWOC-12` is built directly over it. The framework validates closed enums at every `invoke` boundary; an unknown value is a plugin bug that fails the audit run, not a finding the operator must triage.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `criterion_id` | string, kebab-case | yes | Stable identifier for the criterion being checked. **Plugin-scoped** — unique within one plugin, not globally. MUST match an entry in the plugin's declared criteria list. **Stable across releases** — renaming a `criterion_id` is a breaking change to the plugin's contract (see [Stability](#stability)). |
| `severity` | closed enum: `info` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `critical` | yes | Intrinsic severity of the criterion, declared once in the plugin's criteria list — **not** decided per-run. A `critical` finding with `status = "pass"` is normal and means "we checked the most important thing and it's fine." Severity describes the criterion's importance, not the outcome. |
| `status` | closed enum: `pass` \| `fail` \| `not_applicable` \| `not_implemented` | yes | Outcome of this check on this workspace. `not_applicable` is for criteria that don't apply to this workspace's profile (e.g. a multi-tenant clause on a solo workspace). `not_implemented` is the stub-plugin status — used by `audit-iso-9001`, `audit-iso-20000-1`, and `audit-iso-27001` until runtime lands in `BWOC-EPIC-3`. Free-text status values are a plugin bug. |
| `evidence` | structured: `{ kind, value }` where `kind ∈ { "file", "content", "command", "none" }` and `value` is a string | yes | Where the plugin looked. `kind` is always required; `value` is required unless `kind = "none"`. Evidence MUST be reproducible — an operator running the same check by hand finds the same artifact. This is the **Musāvāda** guard: no claim without a referent. See [Evidence kinds](#evidence-kinds). |
| `remedy` | string, plain prose | conditional | Actionable next step. **Required** when `status` is `fail`, `not_applicable`, or `not_implemented` ("why this status, and what to do"). **Omitted** when `status = "pass"`. The framework rejects findings that supply `remedy` with `pass`, and findings that omit it with any other status. |

### Evidence kinds

| `evidence.kind` | `evidence.value` semantics | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | Path relative to the workspace root (e.g. `docs/en/PROJECT-PLAN.en.md`). The file exists at that path. | The criterion is "this artifact exists." |
| `content` | Path with a locator (e.g. `Cargo.toml#workspace.package.license`, `docs/en/SRS.en.md:§3.2`). The plugin found the expected content at the locator. | The criterion is "this artifact contains/declares X." |
| `command` | Shell-safe command the operator can rerun (e.g. `bwoc check --all`). The plugin ran the command and observed its exit. | The criterion is "this command succeeds on this workspace." |
| `none` | Empty string. | `status = "not_applicable"` (no check needed) or `status = "not_implemented"` (runtime deferred). MUST NOT appear with `status = "pass"` or `"fail"` — those statuses always have a referent. |

### Schema rules

- **Closed enums, not free strings.** `severity`, `status`, and `evidence.kind` are validated at plugin load and at every `invoke` boundary. An unknown value is a plugin bug that fails the audit run.
- **No nested findings.** A criterion passes or fails as a unit. Sub-checks are separate criterion entries with their own `criterion_id`. The report stays flat and machine-parseable.
- **Stable serialization order.** Findings serialize in **criterion-declaration order** — the order in which they appear in the plugin's criteria list — not check-execution order. Diffs across runs are meaningful only with this guarantee.
- **JSON is the canonical wire format.** `bwoc audit run --json` (per `BWOC-12`) emits one envelope per plugin: `{ plugin, version, started_at, finished_at, findings: [...] }`. Human-readable output is a renderer over this shape; the JSON is normative.

### Stability

`criterion_id` values are part of the plugin's public surface. Adding criteria is a minor-version bump under the plugin's own semver. **Renaming or removing** a `criterion_id` is a major-version bump (independent of the framework version in `[plugin].compat`) — downstream consumers (diff tooling, report archives, dashboards) key on these identifiers.

### Examples

A passing finding omits `remedy`:

```json
{
  "criterion_id": "29110-bp-project-plan-exists",
  "severity":     "high",
  "status":       "pass",
  "evidence":     { "kind": "file", "value": "docs/en/PROJECT-PLAN.en.md" }
}
```

A failing finding carries `remedy`:

```json
{
  "criterion_id": "29110-bp-traceability-matrix",
  "severity":     "medium",
  "status":       "fail",
  "evidence":     { "kind": "file", "value": "docs/en/TRACEABILITY.en.md" },
  "remedy":       "Create docs/en/TRACEABILITY.en.md linking each SRS requirement to its design element and test case."
}
```

Stub plugins (`audit-iso-9001`, `audit-iso-20000-1`, `audit-iso-27001` per `BWOC-EPIC-2`) emit `status = "not_implemented"` with a uniform remedy:

```json
{
  "criterion_id": "iso-9001-internal-audit-program",
  "severity":     "medium",
  "status":       "not_implemented",
  "evidence":     { "kind": "none", "value": "" },
  "remedy":       "Runtime deferred to BWOC-EPIC-3."
}
```

### Exit codes — `bwoc audit run`

The process exit code is normative and stable across releases. Operators and CI consumers can branch on `$?` without parsing stdout; the `--json` envelope's `summary.fail_count` and `summary.framework_error` fields carry the same signal in structured form.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | No `fail` findings across the selected plugins. Also returned when no audit plugins are enabled (or `--plugin <name>` matched a plugin that emitted only `pass` / `not_applicable` / `not_implemented` findings). |
| `1..=254` | Count of `fail` findings across all selected plugins, clamped at `254`. A run that produces ≥ 255 fails still reports the exact count under `summary.fail_count` in `--json`. |
| `255` | Framework or plugin runtime error — discovery failed, manifest parsed badly, a plugin failed to spawn or returned non-JSON, or a finding violated the schema above. The `--json` envelope's `summary.framework_error` is `true` in this case. |
| `2` | Operator/usage error — no workspace found (no `--workspace`, no `BWOC_WORKSPACE`, no ancestor `.bwoc/workspace.toml`), or `--plugin <name>` did not resolve to an installed audit-kind plugin. |

`0` and `1..=254` mean the framework completed the run cleanly and is reporting on plugin output. `255` means the framework itself could not produce a trustworthy report. `2` means the operator's invocation was wrong before any plugin ran.

---

## Directory Layout

```
modules/plugins/
└── <name>/
    ├── manifest.toml       # required — the contract
    ├── SPEC.md             # required — Obsidian-formatted plugin description
    └── ...                 # implementation (binary, Rust crate, script)
```

`<name>` is `kebab-case`. One plugin per directory. The plugin's `kind` is declared in `manifest.toml` (see [Manifest](#manifest--manifesttoml)) and is not encoded in the directory path — symmetric with [`SKILLS.en.md`](SKILLS.en.md#directory-layout).

---

## Manifest — `manifest.toml`

```toml
[plugin]
name        = "memory-tier2-noop"               # required — must match the directory name
kind        = "memory-backend"                  # required — one of: memory-backend | llm-backend | workflow | audit
version     = "0.1.0"                           # required — semver
description = "No-op Tier 2 memory backend that forwards to Tier 1."   # required — one-sentence summary
compat      = ">=2.5.0"                         # required — semver range; framework versions this plugin works with
entry       = "bwoc-plugin-memory-tier2-noop"   # required — binary on PATH (preferred) or sibling Rust crate name

[config.schema]                                 # optional — omit the table entirely if the plugin takes no config
# Plugin-defined; JSON-schema-lite. The workspace's [plugins.<name>] table is validated against this.
# Each key maps to an inline table with: type, required (bool), and (when required = false) default.
# Example:
# storage_path = { type = "string", required = false, default = "memories/tier2" }
# max_results  = { type = "integer", required = true }
```

### Field reference

| Section | Field | Required | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[plugin]` | `name` | yes | string (kebab-case) | Plugin identifier; must equal the directory name under `modules/plugins/` |
| `[plugin]` | `kind` | yes | enum | One of `memory-backend`, `llm-backend`, `workflow`, `audit`; immutable after `init` |
| `[plugin]` | `version` | yes | string (semver) | Semver of the plugin itself, separate from the framework version |
| `[plugin]` | `description` | yes | string | One-sentence summary; the **only** manifest value where a vendor name is tolerated |
| `[plugin]` | `compat` | yes | string (semver range) | Framework versions this plugin is compatible with; framework refuses to load on mismatch |
| `[plugin]` | `entry` | yes | string | Binary on `PATH` (preferred) or sibling Rust crate name the framework dispatches to |
| `[config.schema]` | (free keys) | no | inline-table per key | Schema the operator's `workspace.toml [plugins.<name>]` block is validated against; each key declares `type`, `required`, optional `default` |

### Neutrality constraint (HARD)

A `memory-backend` plugin must work for any agent regardless of backend. An `llm-backend` plugin must not pretend it is one of the five declared backends. Vendor names in plugin **manifest values** are tolerated only inside `description` (where they describe the integration target); they remain forbidden anywhere else. This is the same **Samānattatā** rule that `bwoc check` already enforces on `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Lifecycle

```
init  → configure → invoke (many) → teardown
```

- **`init`** — called once when the framework first sees the plugin in `workspace.toml`. **Idempotent.** No side-effects on external systems beyond what is necessary to confirm the plugin can run.
- **`configure`** — called with the resolved `[plugins.<name>]` config block. **Idempotent**: re-running with the same block is a no-op; re-running with a changed block reconciles to the new state. Validates the config against `[config.schema]`; refuses to proceed on schema violation.
- **`invoke`** — called once per logical operation (write a memory, dispatch a model call, post to an issue tracker). **Idempotent at the operation level.**
- **`teardown`** — called once when the framework shuts down or the plugin is disabled. **Idempotent.** Cleanup-only.

Idempotency is a **hard requirement at every phase**. The framework may retry an init or configure call after a crash; an `invoke` may run twice if the framework's caller retried; teardown may be replayed across shutdowns. A plugin that mutates external state non-idempotently is broken by design.

### Lifecycle owner per kind

| Kind | Owner | When init fires | When invoke fires |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory-backend` | Agent's memory subsystem | First memory read/write that escalates to Tier 2 | Per Tier 2 read/write |
| `llm-backend` | `bwoc spawn` | Agent spawn whose registry entry names this plugin | Per model call from the agent's harness |
| `workflow` | Agent code that imports the integration | First call from the agent | Per agent-initiated operation |
| `audit` | `bwoc audit` CLI | First `bwoc audit run` that selects this plugin in the current invocation | Per `bwoc audit run [--plugin <name>]` operator invocation; never implicit |

### Hook contract — success, failure, partial state

Plugins integrate via the `entry` field — either a binary on `PATH` or a sibling Rust crate. The contract is therefore expressed in both exit-code (binary) and return-value (crate) forms; the framework treats them as equivalent. For each hook, "success" and "failure" are the dispatch result the framework observes; "partial state" is the plugin author's responsibility to bound.

| Hook | Success means | Failure means | Partial state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `init` | Exit `0` (binary) / returns `Ok` (crate). | Non-zero exit / `Err`. Framework refuses to load the plugin and surfaces the diagnostic on stderr. | Init must fully complete or roll back before failing. The framework treats a failed init as if it never ran. |
| `configure` | Exit `0` / `Ok`. The plugin is ready for `invoke`. | Non-zero exit / `Err` citing the offending key (e.g. `max_results: required, missing`). Framework refuses to start the workspace. | Validate-first, apply-second — never half-apply config. A partial apply is a plugin bug. |
| `invoke` | Exit `0` / `Ok` with a typed result. Stdout is the payload, stderr is diagnostics (binary form). | Non-zero exit / `Err`. Framework surfaces the error to the caller (agent or operator); caller decides whether to retry. | Operations are durable-or-discarded — never half-applied. Retries land on the idempotent path. |
| `teardown` | Exit `0` / `Ok`. Framework releases the plugin slot. | Non-zero exit / `Err`. Logged, not fatal — framework shutdown must not block. | Idempotent on replay. The framework may call teardown again on a subsequent shutdown if the first never completed. |

### Per-phase examples

```text
# init — confirm the plugin can run; no business side-effects yet
init():
  if not writable(cfg.storage_path):
    exit 1, "storage_path not writable: <path>"
  open_lazy_handle(cfg.storage_path)
  exit 0

# configure — validate against [config.schema], then apply atomically
configure({ storage_path: "memories/tier2", max_results: 8 }):
  errors = validate_against_schema(input)
  if errors:
    exit 2, "configure: " + errors.join(", ")
  apply_atomic(input)               # all-or-nothing
  exit 0

# invoke — operation-level idempotency
invoke("write_memory", { id: "m-1", body: "..." }):
  existing = lookup("m-1")
  if existing and body_hash(existing) == body_hash(input):
    exit 0, { status: "noop" }      # replay-safe
  store("m-1", input)
  exit 0, { status: "written" }

# teardown — cleanup-only, idempotent
teardown():
  flush_pending(timeout = 5s)       # best-effort
  close_handles()
  exit 0                            # safe to call twice
```

---

## Loading — `workspace.toml`

The operator declares which plugins this workspace uses by adding entries to `workspace.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]

[plugins.memory-tier2-noop]
enabled      = true
storage_path = "memories/tier2"

[plugins.workflow-github]
enabled = false      # registered but off — kept here to document intent
```

Schema for each `[plugins.<name>]` table:

- `<name>` (table key, string, required) — the installed plugin's directory name under `modules/plugins/`. The key is the plugin name; `kind` is **not** declared in `workspace.toml` — it is owned by the plugin's own `manifest.toml` `[plugin].kind` field and read from there at load time.
- `enabled` (bool, required) — gates whether the plugin is loaded at framework startup. Set `false` to keep the entry as documented intent without loading. Mirrors the `config.manifest.json skills.framework[] enabled` pattern in [`SKILLS.en.md`](SKILLS.en.md#discovery); flip with `bwoc plugin disable <name>` to preserve the entry.
- All other keys (plugin-defined) — validated against the plugin's `[config.schema]` at framework startup. Refused on schema violation; never half-applied (see [Lifecycle](#lifecycle)).

A missing `enabled` field is a manifest error — `bwoc check` rejects entries that omit it. There is no implicit default; explicit intent is the contract.

At framework startup the runtime:

1. Reads the `[plugins]` table from `workspace.toml`.
2. Filters to entries where `enabled` is `true`. Entries with `enabled = false` are kept in `workspace.toml` (as documented intent) but skipped at load.
3. Resolves each entry against the workspace's `modules/plugins/<name>/` directory. `<kind>` is read from the installed plugin's manifest, not encoded in the path.
4. Validates the entry's config block against the plugin's `[config.schema]`, then dispatches `init` followed by `configure`.
5. Refuses to start the workspace if any enabled plugin is missing under `modules/plugins/`, has a `[plugin] compat` mismatch with the running framework version, fails `[config.schema]` validation, or returns a non-zero `init` / `configure` result.

No central index. Plugins exist for a workspace only because they are installed under `modules/plugins/` and named in `workspace.toml`. The resolution lookup is always local to the workspace — no runtime network calls during framework startup. **Anattā** preserved.

---

## CLI Surface

Read-only surfaces (no side-effects on the workspace):

```
bwoc plugin list                    # list installed plugins (enabled + disabled)
bwoc plugin list --enabled          # filter to enabled only
bwoc plugin list --kind memory-backend
bwoc plugin list --json

bwoc plugin show <name>             # full manifest + spec + current config
bwoc plugin show <name> --json
```

Lifecycle surfaces (write — see referenced sections for details):

```
bwoc plugin init <name> --kind <k>  # scaffold a new plugin from modules/plugin-template/
                                    #   (see "Scaffolding from template")

bwoc plugin install <source>        # install from local path / git URL / tarball URL
                                    #   (see "Sources & Installation")

bwoc plugin enable <name>           # set enabled=true in workspace.toml [plugins.<name>]
bwoc plugin disable <name>          # set enabled=false (keeps the entry)

bwoc plugin remove <name>           # delete modules/plugins/<name>/ and clean workspace.toml
                                    #   (see "Removal")
```

No `bwoc plugin verify` in v1 — plugins do not declare a uniform verify gate (the kinds differ too much). Verification is the plugin's own concern, surfaced through its `invoke` exit semantics. A future v2 may add per-kind verify if patterns emerge.

All read-only commands have `--json` twins. Lifecycle commands emit structured JSON when `--json` is passed; `install` exits non-zero on trust-gate failure; `remove` exits non-zero on missing target unless `--yes` was passed.

### "Current workspace" resolution

Plugins are workspace-scoped (unlike skills which are agent-scoped). `enable`, `disable`, `remove` resolve the target workspace in this order:

1. **`--workspace <path>` flag** — explicit override.
2. **`BWOC_WORKSPACE` environment variable**.
3. **Working directory** — walks up from cwd to find the nearest `.bwoc/workspace.toml`.
4. **Otherwise** — error: `no workspace context; pass --workspace <path> or run from inside a workspace`.

The resolution is identical to how `bwoc list` and `bwoc workspace info` already locate the workspace today.

---

## Sources & Installation

A framework plugin enters a workspace either by being authored in place under `modules/plugins/<name>/` or by being installed from one of three source kinds:

| Source kind | Example | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| **Local path** | `bwoc plugin install ./vendor/my-plugin/` | Argument starts with `./`, `../`, or `/` and resolves to a directory |
| **Git URL** | `bwoc plugin install https://github.com/org/plugin.git#v0.1.0` | Argument scheme is `http(s)://` or `git://` AND ends with `.git` (optional `#<ref>`) |
| **Tarball URL** | `bwoc plugin install https://example.com/plugin-0.1.0.tar.gz` | Argument scheme is `http(s)://` AND ends with `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` |

The install mechanism:

1. Resolves the source kind from the argument.
2. **Pre-flight** — if source has no `manifest.toml` at its root, refuse with `source missing manifest.toml; cannot resolve name or kind`. Nothing is fetched / extracted / written.
3. **Trust gate** (see below) — fetches and verifies a SHA-256 checksum.
4. Reads the plugin's manifest from the source to learn its `name` and `kind`. The kind is **always derived from the source manifest** — it cannot be overridden by a flag.
5. Materializes the source into `modules/plugins/<name>/` (copy for local; clone-then-discard-`.git` for git; extract for tarball).
6. Validates the installed manifest with `bwoc check`.
7. Records the install in `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml` (schema below). Only writes the registry record on successful completion.
8. **Does not** auto-enable. The installed plugin is dormant until `bwoc plugin enable <name>` adds an entry to `workspace.toml [plugins.<name>]` with `enabled = true`.

### Re-install and failure handling

- **Target already exists** — if `modules/plugins/<name>/` already exists, the default behavior is to refuse with `<name> already installed at version X; pass --upgrade to replace`.
  - `--upgrade` — replaces in place, retains the `installed-sources.toml` record (updates `last_hash` and `installed_at`).
  - `--force` — replaces unconditionally, even if the current install has uncommitted local edits (a stderr warning lists what was overwritten).
- **Network failure during install** — install is non-atomic by design; on transient failure (download interrupted, extract error), the partial directory is removed before exit and `installed-sources.toml` is **not** updated. Safe to retry.

### Trust gate (v1)

Every install verifies a SHA-256 checksum **before** materializing:

- **Tarball URL** — the CLI fetches `<source>.sha256` (same URL with the `.sha256` suffix), reads the expected digest, and compares against the computed digest of the downloaded archive.
- **Git URL** — the CLI fetches the checksum at the URL with `.git` replaced by `.sha256`. Example:
  - Source: `https://github.com/org/plugin.git#v0.1.0`
  - Checksum: `https://github.com/org/plugin.sha256` (operator publishes a manifest of expected tree-shas keyed by ref)
  - After clone, the framework runs `git rev-parse <ref>^{tree}` and compares against the entry for `<ref>` in the fetched manifest.
  - Operators typically publish this manifest via a GitHub release asset or a separate static-hosted file.
- **Local path** — checksum is optional; if a sibling `<dir>.sha256` exists, it is verified; otherwise the install proceeds (local paths are operator-trusted by convention).

Two flags relax the gate:

- `--no-verify` — skips checksum verification. Emits a stderr warning. Intended for in-development sources served locally over HTTP.
- `--allow-new-source` — required the **first time** a given source URL is installed in this workspace. Establishes "I have inspected this source." Subsequent installs from the same registered source (recorded in `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml`) skip this prompt.

The trust gate matches the SKILLS spec — same flags, same registry file, same semantics. A future Trust v2 (signed envelopes; identity proof) extends both surfaces without breaking the v1 contract.

**Anattā preserved.** There is no central registry, no name-to-URL resolution service, no auto-update mechanism. Every install names its source explicitly. The framework is not a package manager.

### `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml` schema

Shared with SKILLS — a single workspace registry covers both kinds of installs. See [`SKILLS.en.md` — installed-sources schema](SKILLS.en.md#bwocinstalled-sourcestoml-schema) for the full table; plugin entries use `kind = "plugin"` and `target = "modules/plugins/<name>"`.

---

## Scaffolding from template

`bwoc plugin init <name> --kind <kind>` creates a new plugin in `modules/plugins/<name>/` by copying the template at `modules/plugin-template/` and substituting placeholders (including `kind`):

```
modules/plugin-template/
├── manifest.toml          # contains {{pluginName}}, {{pluginVersion}}, {{pluginKind}} placeholders
└── SPEC.md                # Obsidian-formatted; placeholders for plugin name + description
```

Placeholders use the same `{{camelCase}}` convention as `modules/agent-template/` and `modules/skill-template/`. Required substitutions are listed in the template's own [`SPEC.md`](../../modules/plugin-template/SPEC.md).

The `--kind` flag is required — there is no default. Valid values: `memory-backend`, `llm-backend`, `workflow`, `audit`. Future kinds extend this enum without changing the template layout. The flag forces the operator to declare intent up front and avoids producing a manifest with a missing or wrong `kind` field.

`bwoc plugin init` is the recommended way to start a new plugin — manual creation is supported but bypasses placeholder consistency.

### `init` vs `install` — why `--kind` works differently

`init` and `install` treat `kind` asymmetrically by design:

- **`init <name> --kind <kind>`** — operator declares intent; `--kind` is substituted into the new template manifest. Required because no manifest exists yet to derive kind from.
- **`install <source>`** — `kind` is read from the source's `manifest.toml`. Not overridable — a source manifest declaring `kind = "memory-backend"` is installed with that kind preserved in the manifest, regardless of any flag.

This asymmetry exists because the install flow trusts the source author's declared intent: if the source says it is a `workflow` plugin, it is one. Operators who disagree should refuse the install, not edit the manifest after the fact.

## Removal

`bwoc plugin remove <name>`:

1. **Confirms with the user** unless `--yes` was passed. Lists what will be deleted (`modules/plugins/<name>/`) and modified (`workspace.toml [plugins.<name>]`); reports the plugin's `kind` (read from the manifest) for context.
2. **Deletes** `modules/plugins/<name>/` recursively.
3. **Cleans** `workspace.toml` — removes the `[plugins.<name>]` table entirely (not just `enabled = false`).

Idempotent — `remove` on a non-existent target reports "not installed" and exits 0. The `--yes` flag short-circuits the confirmation prompt.

A removed source is not auto-uninstalled from `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml`. Pass `--forget-source` to also drop the source registration.

## Verification

`bwoc check` extends to audit `modules/plugins/<name>/` plus the installed-source registry:

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Manifest parseable | `manifest.toml` is valid TOML and matches the schema above |
| Name matches directory | `[plugin].name == basename(directory)` |
| Kind valid | `[plugin].kind` is one of `memory-backend`, `llm-backend`, `workflow`, `audit` (or a future kind added to the enum) |
| Neutrality | Vendor names only inside `description`; nowhere else |
| `SPEC.md` present | A `SPEC.md` file exists alongside the manifest |
| Required fields | `name`, `kind`, `version`, `description`, `compat`, `entry` all present |
| Compat range valid | `[plugin].compat` parses as a semver range |
| Source registry parseable | `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml` is valid TOML if present |
| No orphan source records | every entry where `kind = "plugin"` in the registry has a matching `modules/plugins/<name>/` directory |
| No orphan installations | every `modules/plugins/<name>/` either has a registry entry OR contains an `.authored-in-place` marker file |
| Registry drift | `installed_hash` in registry matches the current SHA-256 of `modules/plugins/<name>/` (or `bwoc check --update-hashes` was passed to acknowledge drift) |

A failed check exits non-zero on the workspace audit — same surface, same exit semantics as the existing `bwoc check --all`.

## What This Spec Does NOT Cover

- **Skills** — see [`SKILLS.en.md`](SKILLS.en.md). Skills are agent-invoked; plugins are framework-loaded.
- **The five declared backends** (`claude`, `antigravity`, `codex`, `kimi`, `ollama`) — they are first-class, not plugins. See [`ARCHITECTURE.en.md`](ARCHITECTURE.en.md).
- **The first reference plugin itself** — see story `BWOC-7` and (once landed) `modules/plugins/memory-tier2-noop/SPEC.md`.
- **Trust v2 / signing of plugin binaries** — deferred. Plugin binaries today are trusted by virtue of being installed under `modules/plugins/`; richer trust gating lands with the broader Trust v2 work.
