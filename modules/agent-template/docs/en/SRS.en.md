## 0. Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements — functional and non-functional — of the Agent Base Profile, along with its interfaces and data contracts.

### 0.2 Scope
The system under specification is a **template repository**, not a runtime.

### 0.3 Notation
- **Priority:** M = Must, S = Should, C = Could
- **Verify:** T = Test, I = Inspection, D = Demo, A = Analysis
- **Requirement ID:** `FR-{Magga}.{seq}` — e.g., `FR-7.1` is the first requirement under *Sammā-sati*

## 2. Cross-Cutting Principles

### 2.1 Yoniso Manasikāra — Verify Before Act
Every FR that reads from memory must verify against current state — covered explicitly by FR-7.7 and FR-7.17.

### 2.2 Tilakkhaṇa — State Philosophy

| Mark | Impact on FRs |
|---|---|
| Aniccaṃ | FR-7.10 (prune), FR-4.8 (cleanup), FR-7.2 (timestamps) |
| Dukkhaṃ | FR-4.8 (no stale branch), FR-7.20 (no stale memory) |
| Anattā | FR-4.2 (no shared dir), FR-4.3 (no stash), FR-4.8 (release) |

### 2.3 Mattaññutā — Scope Discipline
- No work outside the task's scope (FR-4.5)
- No saving of derivable information (FR-7.9)
- No debugging effects outside the task's boundary (FR-1.3)

## 4. External Interfaces

### 4.1 LLM CLI Interfaces

| Backend | Entry File | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|

### 4.2 Deep Memory Backend Interface (Tier 2)

```
{{deepMemoryCmd}} wake-up                     # emit session-start context to stdout
{{deepMemoryCmd}} search "<query>"            # emit ranked results to stdout
{{deepMemoryCmd}} mine <path> --mode <mode>   # persist learnings
```

Exit codes: 0 success, non-zero failure.

### 4.3 Project Submodule Interface
Project repos are mounted via `git submodule add <url> projects/<name>`.
