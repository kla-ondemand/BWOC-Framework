# Workspace

A **workspace** is a directory that holds one or more BWOC agents plus the metadata the CLI needs to operate on them coherently. The CLI accepts a user-specified workspace path. **Operational commands refuse to run until the workspace is structurally complete** (fail-fast, with an actionable error).

This document defines the workspace concept, the on-disk structure, the validation rules, the central per-user memory at `~/.bwoc/`, and how the CLI resolves which workspace to act on.

---

## Concept

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | A directory the user designates as the home for their BWOC work. May contain many agents. |
| **Workspace marker** | The `.bwoc/` directory at the workspace root. Its presence + valid contents make a directory a workspace. |
| **Agent** | An incarnated BWOC agent — its own self-contained sub-directory inside (or outside) a workspace. |
| **Central memory** | Per-user memory at `~/.bwoc/memory/`, shared by every agent the user runs on this machine. |

Workspaces let a user organize many agents under one roof — pinned models, shared memory, machine-level config — without coupling them to a single git repository.

## Workspace Structure (Required)

```
<workspace>/
├── .bwoc/                    # workspace marker + metadata  (REQUIRED)
│   ├── workspace.toml        # workspace config             (REQUIRED)
│   ├── agents.toml           # auto-maintained agent index  (REQUIRED — created by CLI)
│   └── memory/               # workspace-scoped memory      (OPTIONAL)
│       ├── MEMORY.md
│       └── *.md
├── agents/                   # incarnated agents             (RECOMMENDED location)
│   ├── agent-foo/
│   └── agent-bar/
└── ...                       # user's other files (the workspace can coexist with anything)
```

### `.bwoc/workspace.toml` — Required Fields

```toml
[workspace]
name = "my-workspace"            # required, slug
version = "0.1.0"                # required, SemVer of BWOC framework this conforms to
created = "2026-05-22T05:50:00Z" # required, ISO 8601 UTC

[defaults]
backend = "claude"               # optional: claude | gemini | codex | kimi
lang = "en"                      # optional: BCP 47 / ISO 639-1
agents_dir = "agents"            # optional, default "agents" (relative to workspace root)
```

### `.bwoc/agents.toml` — Auto-Maintained

```toml
# Updated by `bwoc new` and `bwoc retire`. Manual edits are honored but not recommended.

[[agent]]
id = "agent-foo"
path = "agents/agent-foo"
backend = "claude"
incarnated = "2026-05-22T05:51:00Z"
status = "active"

[[agent]]
id = "agent-bar"
path = "agents/agent-bar"
backend = "gemini"
incarnated = "2026-05-22T05:52:00Z"
status = "active"
```

---

## Validation Rules — "Complete Before Work"

A workspace is **complete** iff all of:

1. `.bwoc/` directory exists.
2. `.bwoc/workspace.toml` exists, parses as TOML, and contains required `[workspace]` fields (`name`, `version`, `created`).
3. `.bwoc/agents.toml` exists and parses as TOML (empty `[[agent]]` array is acceptable — new workspace).
4. The `agents_dir` named in `workspace.toml` (or its default) exists, even if empty.
5. The `version` field in `workspace.toml` is a parseable SemVer.

**Operational commands** (`bwoc spawn`, `bwoc new`, `bwoc check`, `bwoc list`, `bwoc retire`) call validation before doing work. On failure they exit with code `2` and an actionable message naming the missing or malformed part. **No agent work runs against an incomplete workspace.**

**Inspection commands** (`bwoc workspace info`, `bwoc workspace validate`) report status without operating. `bwoc init` creates the structure when it is absent.

## CLI Surface

| Command | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `bwoc init [path]` | Create workspace structure at `path` (default: current directory). Idempotent — refuses to overwrite an existing `workspace.toml`. | Phase 1 v2.0 |
| `bwoc workspace info [path]` | Print resolved workspace path, config, and agent count. | Phase 1 v2.0 |
| `bwoc workspace validate [path]` | Run all validation rules; print findings; exit 0 if complete, 2 if incomplete. | Phase 1 v2.0 |
| `bwoc new <name>` | Incarnate a new agent into the workspace (uses `agents_dir`). | Phase 1 v2.0 |
| `bwoc list` | List agents registered in the workspace (from `agents.toml`). | Phase 1 v2.0 |
| `bwoc spawn <name>` | Validate workspace, then exec the agent's backend. | Phase 1 v2.0 |

### Workspace Resolution

Precedence — the first matching wins:

1. `--workspace <path>` global flag.
2. `BWOC_WORKSPACE` environment variable.
3. The nearest ancestor directory of `cwd` that contains a `.bwoc/` directory (walk upward).
4. Current working directory, if it itself contains `.bwoc/`.
5. **No workspace** → operational commands fail with code `2` and a suggestion to run `bwoc init`.

## Central Memory — `~/.bwoc/`

Independent of any workspace, the CLI maintains a **per-user** directory at `~/.bwoc/`. This is the user-level memory shared by every BWOC agent the user runs on this machine.

```
~/.bwoc/
├── config.toml               # user-level config (default lang, default backend, etc.)
├── memory/                   # central memory (Tier 1 format)
│   ├── MEMORY.md             # index (≤ 200 lines — Mattaññutā)
│   └── *.md                  # typed memories (user, feedback, project, reference)
├── workspaces.toml           # known workspaces registry (auto-maintained)
└── logs/                     # CLI invocation logs (rotated)
```

### `~/.bwoc/config.toml` — User Defaults

```toml
[defaults]
backend = "claude"
lang = "th"
workspace = "/Users/lps/bwoc"    # optional: default workspace path

[memory]
cap_lines = 200                  # MEMORY.md index cap
```

### `~/.bwoc/memory/` — Memory Format

Same two-tier format as per-agent memory (see [`modules/agent-template/memories/README.md`](../../modules/agent-template/memories/README.md)). The `MEMORY.md` index is capped at 200 lines (Mattaññutā). Individual memory files use the four types: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`.

Agents access central memory through their `deepMemoryCmd` or, in Phase 2+, via the `bwoc-agent` runtime which exposes a unified memory API spanning the three scopes.

### Memory Scopes (clarification)

| Scope | Path | Visible to |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-agent** | `<agent>/memories/` | One agent only |
| **Per-workspace** | `<workspace>/.bwoc/memory/` | All agents in this workspace (optional) |
| **Per-user (central)** | `~/.bwoc/memory/` | All agents this user runs on this machine |
| **Tier 2 (deep)** | pluggable backend | All scopes (vector DB, semantic search, etc.) |

Higher scopes are **read-shared** by default; **writes** require explicit intent so an agent does not silently mutate context outside its own scope.

## Lifecycle — Workspace and the Arc

The workspace participates in every phase of the BWOC arc:

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| **uppāda** | `bwoc init` creates the workspace; `bwoc new` adds an agent to it (registers in `agents.toml`). |
| **ṭhiti** | `bwoc spawn` validates the workspace first, then exec's the agent's backend in the agent directory. The workspace itself is long-lived — it persists across many agent operations. |
| **vaya** | `bwoc retire <agent>` removes the agent from `agents.toml`, optionally archives its directory; the workspace remains. `bwoc workspace prune` (Phase 3) reclaims orphaned entries. |
