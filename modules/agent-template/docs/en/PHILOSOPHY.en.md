## 0. Preface

This document is the **conceptual core** of the Agent Base Profile system. All other documents reference and conform to it. When documents conflict, PHILOSOPHY wins.

Buddhist principles are used here as an **engineering framework**, not as religious interpretation. Those interested in the dhamma in depth should study primary Buddhist sources directly.

## 0.1 The Arc — uppāda · ṭhiti · vaya

Before the 22 frameworks, one shape: every conditioned phenomenon has an arc. **AN 3.47 (Saṅkhata Sutta)** names three characteristics of a conditioned thing —

> *Uppādo paññāyati* — its arising is discerned.
> *Ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati* — its alteration-while-persisting is discerned.
> *Vayo paññāyati* — its passing-away is discerned.

In BWOC, an agent (and each of its tasks, sessions, and worktrees) is a conditioned phenomenon — and follows this arc.

| Phase | Pali | Engineering surface |
|---|---|---|
| Arising | **uppāda** | Incarnation (`incarnate.sh`), persona definition, capability declaration (Attanutata), manifest resolution. |
| Persisting (with change) | **ṭhiti** | Operation: task planning by Ariyasacca 4, action by Magga 8, memory by Sammā-sati, communication by Brahmavihāra 4. Change *within* persistence — not stasis. |
| Passing-away | **vaya** | Cessation: worktree cleanup (Anattā), branch release, memory prune (Mattaññutā), task closure logged. |

The 22 frameworks in §1 are all subordinate to this arc. They specify how arising is principled, how persistence-with-change stays disciplined, and how passing-away releases cleanly.

## 1. The 22 Frameworks

### Group A — Process Frameworks

#### 1. Ariyasacca 4 (Four Noble Truths) — Problem-Solving Spine
Used as the structure of the PRD and as the agent's task-planning method.

| Truth | Use |
|---|---|
| Dukkha | Define the problem |
| Samudaya | Find the root cause |
| Nirodha | Set a measurable target |
| Magga | Plan and execute |

#### 2. Magga 8 (Noble Eightfold Path) — Functional Requirements
Eight pillars in the SRS.

| Pillar | In the System |
|---|---|
| Sammā-diṭṭhi | Persona, Identity |
| Sammā-saṅkappa | Goal setting, planning |
| Sammā-vācā | Inter-agent communication |
| Sammā-kammanta | Worktree, commits |
| Sammā-ājīva | Trust, neutrality |
| Sammā-vāyāma | Verification gates |
| Sammā-sati | Memory system |
| Sammā-samādhi | Focus, session |

#### 3. Khandha 5 (Five Aggregates) — Architecture
Structure of ARCHITECTURE document.

| Aggregate | In the System |
|---|---|
| Rūpa | File layout |
| Vedanā | I/O, hooks |
| Saññā | Memory, recognition |
| Saṅkhāra | Logic, transformations |
| Viññāṇa | Runtime, awareness |

---

### Group B — State Frameworks

#### 4. Tilakkhaṇa (Three Marks) — State Philosophy
Everything has three marks; design must conform.

| Mark | Impact |
|---|---|
| Aniccaṃ | Memory needs pruning, timestamps |
| Dukkhaṃ | Stale branches = dukkha → cleanup |
| Anattā | No clinging to branches, worktrees |

#### 5. Paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination) — Failure Analysis [NEW]
The principle "this exists because that exists" — used for failure modes and error chain analysis.

Key insight: **The visible problem is usually not the problem to fix.** Trace conditions backward.

System uses include:
- Root cause analysis when an agent errs
- Failure propagation tracing
- Cascading failure prevention
- Post-mortem analysis

#### 6. Kamma 3 (Three Doors of Action) — Audit Trail [NEW]
Three channels of action — used as a logging skeleton.

| Kamma | In the System |
|---|---|
| Kāyakamma | File operations, commits (visible) |
| Vacīkamma | Messages, logs (readable) |
| Manokamma | Decisions, plans (inferred) |

---

### Group C — Growth Frameworks

#### 7. Iddhipāda 4 (Four Paths to Accomplishment) — Engine of Work
Success metrics.

| Path | KPI |
|---|---|

#### 8. Bhāvanā 4 (Four Cultivations) — Agent Lifecycle [NEW]
Four stages of growth, used for agent lifecycle management.

| Stage | Phase | Indicator |

| Kāya-bhāvanā | Incarnation — birth | Template materialized, placeholders set |
| Sīla-bhāvanā | Onboarding — learning rules | Conventions internalized, first task done |
| Citta-bhāvanā | Operational — competent work | Stable completion, low retry rate |
| Paññā-bhāvanā | Mentorship — teaching others | Patterns extracted and shared |

#### 9. Paññā 3 (Three Roots of Wisdom) — Self-Improvement Loop [NEW]
Wisdom arises three ways, used as the self-improvement system.

| Type | In the System |
|---|---|
| Sutamayā paññā | Learning from docs, conventions, examples |
| Cintāmayā paññā | Synthesizing — planning, pattern extraction |
| Bhāvanāmayā paññā | Learning from practice — feedback, retrospectives |

#### 10. Ariya-dhana 7 (Seven Noble Treasures) — Capability Maturity [NEW]
Seven treasures of a noble person, used as a maturity model.

| Treasure | In the System | Level |
|---|---|---|
| Saddhā | Trust in conventions | L1 |
| Sīla | Following rules | L2 |
| Hiri-Ottappa | Awareness of errors | L3 |
| Suta | Knowledge depth | L4 |
| Cāga | Sharing capability | L5 |
| Paññā | Independent judgment | L6 |

#### 14. Brahmavihāra 4 — Error UX [NEW]
Four divine abidings, used for user response and error handling.

| Abode | In the System |
|---|---|
| Mettā | Friendly tone in messages |
| Karuṇā | Suggest fixes, not just report errors |
| Muditā | Celebrate user wins, learn from them |

| Buddha-visaya | Do not speculate about LLM provider intent |
| Jhāna-visaya | Do not reason from model internals |
| Kamma-vipāka | Do not predict long-term business outcomes |

> *Note: v1 used acinteyya for "no debugging outside task scope" — replaced with mattaññutā in v2 since it fits better*

#### 18. Satipaṭṭhāna 4 — Observability [NEW — fully expanded]
Used as the observability framework.

| Foundation | Observes | In the System |
|---|---|---|

## 4. Changes from v1.0

### 4.1 Removed forced metaphors
- v1 used *acinteyya* for "no debugging outside task scope" — strained
- v2 uses *mattaññutā* (knowing moderation) — better fit
- *acinteyya* now restricted to four cases that match its original meaning

### 4.2 Fixed cross-cutting duplication
- v1 had *yoniso manasikāra* in FR, NFR, DP — duplicated 3-4 places
- v2 lives in FR-7.7 and FR-7.17; other places reference

### 4.3 Added six new frameworks + extended existing
- Paṭiccasamuppāda → docs/FAILURE-MODES.md
- Bhāvanā 4 → docs/LIFECYCLE.md
- Paññā 3 → docs/SELF-IMPROVEMENT.md
- Brahmavihāra → docs/PRD (Error UX section)
- Aparihāniya-dhamma → [`docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md`](../../../../docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md) (framework-root operator-facing spec drafted 2026-05-23)
- Taṇhā 3 → docs/THREAT-MODEL.md
- Kalyāṇamitta → [`interconnect/trust.md`](../../interconnect/trust.md) (spec draft v2026.5.23 — 7 declared booleans verified by `bwoc check`)
- Satipaṭṭhāna → docs/OBSERVABILITY.md (fully expanded)
- Ariya-dhana 7 → docs/LIFECYCLE.md (maturity)
- Kamma 3 → docs/OBSERVABILITY.md (audit)
- Sīla 5 → docs/THREAT-MODEL.md (baseline)

## 5. Closing Note

The Buddhist frameworks here are used as engineering thinking aids, not religious interpretation. The mappings to technical concepts are useful **analogies**, not claims that "Buddhism teaches software architecture."

For depth in dhamma, study primary Buddhist sources directly.
