#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — one-command install (or upgrade) of the bwoc toolkit.
#
# Builds and installs BOTH binaries to ~/.cargo/bin/:
#   bwoc        — the CLI (init, new, list, start, stop, status, etc.)
#   bwoc-agent  — the per-agent daemon (spawned by `bwoc start`)
#
# The agent template is embedded in the `bwoc` binary at compile time,
# so the installed CLI works from any directory — no on-disk template
# required.
#
# Requires: a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs/).
#
# Usage (from a clone of bwoc-framwork):
#   ./scripts/install.sh           # install or upgrade in place (uses --force)
#   ./scripts/install.sh --help    # this message
#
# Or one-liner from the repo root (CLI only — won't get bwoc-agent):
#   cargo install --path crates/bwoc-cli --locked --force
#

#   ./scripts/bump-version.sh      # manual major/minor/patch SemVer bumps
#                                  # (patch is also auto-bumped on every edit by
#                                  # .claude/hooks/auto-version.sh)
