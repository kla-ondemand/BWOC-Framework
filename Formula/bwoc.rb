# Homebrew formula for BWOC — backend-neutral spec + Rust runtime for AI coding agents.
#
# Tap install:
#
#   brew tap bemindlabs/bwoc https://github.com/bemindlabs/BWOC-Framework
#   brew install bwoc
#
# Updating: when a new CalVer release lands, bump `version`, the four `url`
# lines (tag fragment) and their `sha256` to match the new release's
# `.sha256` sidecars. Each release.yml run produces sidecars at
#
#   https://github.com/bemindlabs/BWOC-Framework/releases/download/<tag>/bwoc-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz.sha256
#
# The first 64 hex chars of each file is the sha256 to paste below.

    # of itself — installing it into the same `bin` is what makes the harness
    # paths (chat --tui, eval, --headless, --lead, --task) work on a brew
    # install. Archives carry it from v2026.8.20-1 onward (issue #460).
