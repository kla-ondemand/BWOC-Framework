//! "What's New" surface — shown two ways:
//!   1. A full section in the no-subcommand banner (always visible there).
//!   2. A one-line upgrade notice on any subcommand, printed once per
//!      MAJOR.MINOR change (npm-style) so it never spams across patch
//!      bumps and never pollutes piped/`--json` stdout.
//!
//! Highlights live here as the single source — the banner imports them.
//! The `HEADLINE` version is derived from Cargo at compile time; update only
//! its prose tagline + `HIGHLIGHTS` on each release that's worth shouting.

Off by default; unix only.",
    "**Bring back what you sent (3.13).** In the chat, `PgUp`/`PgDn` step through the lines you already sent from that input — the first `PgUp` sets your half-typed line aside, `PgDn` past the newest brings it back; scrolling stays on `↑`/`↓`, the wheel and `End`. A harness run that is killed (SIGKILL, OOM, panic) is still recorded on the next run, as `end_reason = \"abandoned\"` with an Error span.",
    "**Traces you can turn on (3.12).** Release binaries now carry the OpenTelemetry exporter: set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and a session emits `invoke_agent` → `chat <model>` → `execute_tool <tool>` spans in the GenAI conventions, with `gen_ai.provider.name` taken from the live client. Unset, nothing is sent.",
    "**Click a pane to talk to it (3.11).** With agent panes open, a click on a pane's input box focuses it (Shift/Option-drag selects text while panes are open); `/undo` no longer deletes a file the harness could not read; the context pane's changed-files list puts re-edits first and a linked worktree shows its branch.",
    "**The model you see is the model that answered (3.10).** When LiteLLM quietly answers from a fallback model — a `max_tokens` over the limit sends `local-chat` to a 4B group — the chat shows `⚠ this reply is from …` before the reply and keeps asking for the model you chose; `/agents` panes run in the agent's own directory, so each answers with its own `AGENTS.md`, persona, memory and history (3.9.1).",
    "**Every agent in the workspace, one window (3.9).** `/agents` opens `claude`-backend agents in panes too — the harness's chat-only `cli` provider on the CLI's own login, no API key; the pane says the CLI runs its own tools outside the harness sandbox.",
