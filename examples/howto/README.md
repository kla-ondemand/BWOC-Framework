# How-To Recipes

Short, runnable, one-task-each. Each recipe lists prerequisites, exact commands, and what success looks like.

## Available

| Recipe | What you'll do | Time |
|---|---|---|
| [`first-agent.md`](first-agent.md) | Init a workspace, incarnate your first agent, spawn the backend | ~5 min |
| [`configure-backends.md`](configure-backends.md) | Switch which LLM backend (claude / agy / codex / kimi) an agent uses | ~2 min |
| [`workspace-layout.md`](workspace-layout.md) | Organize a workspace: agents/, projects/, notes/, central memory | ~3 min |
| [`diagnose-and-fix.md`](diagnose-and-fix.md) | Use `bwoc doctor` to find and auto-fix common issues | ~2 min |

## Planned

- `add-a-new-backend.md` — once Phase 2 backend SDK lands, what it takes to add a 5th backend
- `interconnect-two-agents.md` — Phase 3 sammā-vācā channel between agents
- `monorepo-multi-stack.md` — one workspace, multiple projects in different languages

## Convention

Each how-to file has the same shape:

1. **Goal** — one sentence on what you'll have at the end
2. **Prerequisites** — what must already be in place
3. **Steps** — numbered, exact commands, expected output
4. **Verify** — how to know it worked
5. **What's next** — pointers to deeper material

When you write a new how-to, mimic the existing files' structure for consistency.
